              Business immigration to Canada refers to various programs and
              pathways that enable foreign nationals to enter the country to
              establish or manage a business. Canada encourages entrepreneurs,
              investors, and self-employed individuals to contribute to the
              economy and create jobs. Here’s an overview of some key aspects of
              business immigration to Canada:

                      Many provinces in Canada have their own immigration
                      streams for business immigration for candidates with
                      entrepreneurial or management experience. Each province
                      sets its criteria, which may include investment amounts,
                      business experience, and job creation commitments.
                      Candidates who fulfil the eligibility criteria and
                      successfully complete and submit the application receive a
                      provincial nomination. This provincial nomination then
                      allows the applicant to subm it an application for
                      permanent residence.
