      description: (
        <p>
          Sponsoring your spouse, partner or child involves helping them obtain
          their Permanent Residency (PR) and being able to support them
          financially, ensuring that they do not require social assistance from
          the government.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>What is the eligibility criteria?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          To sponsor your spouse, partner or child;
          <br /> <br />
          <ul>
            <li>You must be above the age of 18 years</li>
            <li>You are a Canadian citizen or</li>
            <li>
              You are a person registered in Canada as an Indian under the
              Canadian Indian Act or
            </li>
            <li>You are a Permanent Resident or Citizen of Canada</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <span>How much does it cost to sponsor?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          A payment of $150 is required for each dependent child or an adopted
          child. Moreover, $1,050 is required if you are sponsoring a spouse or
          partner of your relative.
          <br />
          <br />
          Along with the above fees, the government processing fees include:
          <br />
          <br />
          <Table />
          <br />
          <span>Who can you sponsor?</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          As a Canadian PR, you can sponsor your spouse, common-law partner,
          conjugal partner and/or dependent children.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your <span>spouse</span> can be of either sex, legally married to you
          and at least 18 years of age.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your <span>common-law partner</span> can be either sex, at least 18
          years of age, is not legally married to you, has been living with you
          for minimum 12 consecutive months without any long periods apart. If
          time has been spent away from each other, it should be short and
          temporary. Sponsors will be asked to give proof of your common-law
          relationship.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your <span>conjugal partner</span> is not legally married to you or in
          a common-law relationship, at least 18 years old, can be either sex,
          has been in a relationship with you for at least 1 years and lives
          outside of Canada.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your <span>children</span> may qualify as dependents if they are under
          22 years old and don't have a spouse or common-law partner. Children
          above 22 years of age can also qualify as dependents if they are
          unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or
          physical condition and have depended on their parents for financial
          assistance before the age of 22.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            What are the other alternatives to help my family come to Canada?
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are unable to avail the sponsorship option, your family may
          qualify for other pathways to PR in Canada.
          <br />
