        A super visa is a multiple entry visitor visa specifically for the
        parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
        It allows holders to stay in Canada for up to two years at a time
        without needing to renew their status.
        <br />
        <br />
        The super visa allows eligible parents and grandparents to stay
        temporarily in Canada. To stay permanently, parents and grandparents
        must be sponsored for permanent residence by their Canadian child or
        grandchild.

        <sp>Super Visa vs Visitor Visa</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Super visas are a type of Canadian visitor visa that are only available
        to parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
        The biggest difference between a super visa and a visitor visa is the
        length of time you are allowed to stay in Canada. Normally, a visitor
        visa can be valid for a stay of up to 6 months. To prolong your stay in
        Canada you need to apply to extend your visa. With a super visa, you may
        be able to stay in Canada for up to two years at a time without needing
        to apply for an extension.

        <br />
        <sp>How to Apply for a Super Visa</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can apply for a super visa online, or by submitting a paper-based
        application. In either case, you must prove that you are the parent or
        grandparent of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. Your
        application needs to include a letter of invitation from your child or
        grandchild that includes plans for your care and information about the
        number of people living in their household in Canada. You will also be
        required to demonstrate that you have private health insurance from a
        Canadian insurance company valid for at least one year. Your child or
        grandchild will also be required to demonstrate that they have enough
        funds to support you during your visit by meeting the Low Income Cut-Off
        (LICO) minimum for their family unit size.

        <sp>Super Visa for Visa-Exempt Visitors</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on their country of citizenship, some foreign nationals do not
        require a visitor visa to visit Canada. These are referred to as
        visa-exempt visitors. Visa-exempt visitors are only allowed to remain in
        Canada for a period of up to six months without renewing their status.
        So, parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent
        residents who are visa-exempt may still want to apply for a super visa.
        This will allow them to remain in Canada for up to two years at a time,
        increasing the time they can spend with their loved ones in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        Visa-exempt parents and grandparents who apply for a super visa have to
        follow the same application procedure detailed above. However,
        successful applicants will be issued a letter to present to the border
        services officer when they enter Canada, which authorises their stay,
        instead of a visa. Visa-exempt visitors who travel to Canada by air are
        required to apply for an electronic travel authorization (eTA), even if
        they have successfully applied for a super visa.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Super Visa Extensions</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Super visas allow holders to remain in Canada for up to two years. If
        you want to stay in Canada for longer than two years, you must apply to
        extend your stay. You should submit your extension application no later
        than 30 days before your current status expires. If your current visa
        expires while your extension application is still being processed, you
        may remain in Canada while waiting for a decision to be made. This is
        called implied status.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Parent and Grandparent Sponsorship</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        As an alternative to the super visa, which allows holders to stay in
        Canada temporarily, you may wish to pursue permanent immigration through
        the Parent and Grandparent Sponsorship program.
