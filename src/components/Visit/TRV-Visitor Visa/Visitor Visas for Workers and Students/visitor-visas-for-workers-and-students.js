        A visitor visa, also known as a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), is an
        official document for immigration that permits individuals from foreign
        countries to travel to and enter Canada. If you are not from a
        visa-exempt nation, you will require a visitor visa to enter Canada,
        regardless of whether you are visiting as a student, temporary worker,
        or a tourist.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>You can apply for a visitor Visa from inside Canada.</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In case you have a valid study or work permit while in Canada you have
        the option to apply for Tourist Visa if you want to leave and return to
        Canada in the near future, and have an existing visitor visa thatâ€™s
        expired, or is about to expire, or that was valid for only 1 entry.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>You can apply for a visitor Visa from outside Canada.</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In case you are applying to work or study in Canada, you will be needing
        a visitor visa to travel to Canada. The study or work permit as issued
        are not visas or travel documents.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are two categories of Canadian visitor visas: single- and
        multiple-entry visas.
        <br />
        <br />
        A single-entry visa permits foreign nationals to enter Canada only once,
        whereas a multiple-entry visa allows them to come and go as frequently
        as they want as long as the visa remains valid. Applicants are
        automatically considered for multiple-entry visas, and single-entry
        visas are only granted in exceptional circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        A multiple-entry visitor visa grants the holder a stay of up to six
        months each time they visit Canada, with no limit on the number of
        visits, as long as the visa is still valid. The visa can be valid for up
        to 10 years, but the visa officer has the discretion to determine the
        exact validity period.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you possess a study or work permit and are not otherwise exempt from
        needing a visa, you will automatically be given a visitor visa to enter
        Canada to obtain your permit, typically a multiple-entry visa. If you
        temporarily leave Canada during your studies or temporary work, you will
        not need to apply for a new visitor visa to re-enter Canada, as long as
        both your permit and visa are still valid.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Who Needs a Visitor Visa</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any individual who is not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or
        eligible for visa-exempt entry must obtain a visitor visa to enter
        Canada. Canadian permanent residents are not eligible to apply for a
        visitor visa, even if their permanent resident card has expired.
        Instead, they must apply for a permanent resident travel document
        (PRTD). Canadian citizens, including those with dual citizenship, are
        also not allowed to apply for a visitor visa. They must travel using a
        valid Canadian passport. If you are transiting through Canada or
        visiting for business purposes, separate provisions may apply,
        potentially requiring a business visitor visa, particularly if you are
        not coming as a temporary foreign worker.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Visa-Exempt Countries</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        With the exception of Canadian citizens and permanent residents,
        individuals who are visa-exempt are not required to obtain a visitor
        visa to enter Canada. Canada has established agreements with several
        countries, exempting their citizens from the need for a visa for stays
        of up to six months. However, if individuals from visa-exempt countries
        plan to enter Canada by air, they must obtain a valid electronic travel
        authorization (eTA).
        <br />
        <br />
        For those entering by land or sea, a valid passport from a visa-exempt
        country is sufficient. The only exception to this rule is for citizens
        of the United States. Due to the extensive Canada-U.S. border, which
        remains undefended, numerous Canadian and U.S. citizens cross it daily.
        U.S. citizens can travel to Canada with a valid U.S. passport and are
        not required to have a visitor visa or eTA, provided their stay does not
        exceed six months.
        <br />
        <br />
        U.S. permanent residents, also known as Green Card holders, are exempt
        from the visa requirement regardless of their country of citizenship.
        Nevertheless, they must have an eTA to fly to or transit through a
        Canadian airport and must present a valid Green Card and a valid
        passport when entering Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How to Apply</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are multiple ways to apply for a visitor visa to enter Canada:
        through the online application, a paper application, or in person at a
        Visa Application Center (VAC). In the case of a family traveling
        together, each individual, including dependent children, must complete
        their own application, but the applications can be submitted together.
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on their country of citizenship, applicants may be required to
        include biometric information in their application. This entails
        providing fingerprints and a photograph at a designated biometric
        collection service point. Applicants can choose to provide biometrics
        after submitting the visitor visa application online, as prompted, or at
        the same time if applying in person at a VAC.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Extending a Visitor Visa</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Visitor visas, whether they are single entry or multiple entry, permit
        foreign nationals to legally reside in Canada for a maximum of six
        months. After this period, your legal status will expire, and it is
        necessary to leave Canada. If you wish to prolong your stay beyond six
        months, you must apply for an extension while your temporary resident
        status is still valid. It is recommended to submit your extension
        application at least 30 days before your status expires. In the event
        that your current visa expires while your extension application is being
        processed, you are allowed to remain in Canada under what is known as
        implied status, waiting for a decision on your application.
        Alternatively, if you meet the eligibility criteria for one of Canada's
        immigration programs, you have the option to apply for permanent
        resident status.

        <sp>Why Visitor Visas Get Denied</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Visitor visas may sometimes face rejection due to various factors such
        as incomplete documentation, financial instability, criminal background,
        health concerns, ambiguous travel intentions, limited ties to the home
        country, previous travel history issues, misrepresentation, records of
        overstaying, or illegal status. To gain a thorough understanding of
        these reasons and valuable insights on enhancing your visa application,
        we encourage you to explore our comprehensive article titled "Top
        Reasons Behind Canada Visitor Visa Refusals". It provides guidance that
        can significantly increase your chances of a successful visa approval.
