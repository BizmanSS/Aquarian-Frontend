        A Designated Learning Institution, or DLI, is a school that admits
        international students. A letter of acceptance from a DLI is essential
        to obtaining a Canadian study permit.

        </ul>
        <br />
        All primary and secondary schools in Canada are DLIs. Post-secondary
        schools must receive permission from the provincial government to accept
        international students.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to come to Canada to study at the post-secondary level, make
        sure that your school and program of study is on the list of Canadian
        DLIs.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to stay in Canada after you graduate, make sure to select a
        DLI that will allow you to qualify for a Post-Graduation Work Permit.

        <br />
        <br /> <br />
        Becoming an international student in Canada is a two-step process.
        <br />
        <br />
        First, you need to be accepted into a Canadian school, or designated
        learning institution. Once you have a letter of acceptance, you can
        apply for a study permit from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
        Canada (IRCC).
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are issued a study permit, it is on the basis of your acceptance
        into a Canadian school. However, if you are studying at the
        post-secondary level, you can change your school, program, field of
        study, or level of study without needing to apply for a new study
        permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you’re accepted into the program you want to transfer into, you
        just need to notify IRCC if you have changed schools. You can do that
        online through your MyCIC account.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Designated Learning Institution Number</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Every post-secondary school that admits international students has a
        unique DLI number. The DLI number can be found on the study permit
        application form. It is the number that begins with the letter “O”.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to come to Canada as an international student, first ensure
        that your school is on the list of Designated Learning Institutions
        (DLIs). Schools with several campuses or smaller colleges may have a
        different DLI number for each location.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Non DLI Schools</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If a school is not designated by its provincial or territorial authority
        as a DLI, then it is not eligible to host international students.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you submit a study permit application for a non-DLI school, it will
        be refused. If the school you are studying at loses its DLI status, you
        can remain at the school until your study permit expires. Otherwise, you
        may or may transfer to an alternative DLI.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Primary and Secondary Schools</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In Canada, all primary and secondary schools are DLIs.
        <br />
        <br />
        In most provinces, these schools offer education from Grade One to Grade
        Twelve. When a student graduates from secondary school they receive
        their high school diploma.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dependent minor children do not need a study permit. If you have minor
        children and are coming to Canada on a work or study permit, they will
        be eligible to attend school. There is no need to apply for a separate
        study permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Changing Programs</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If an international student chooses to change programs within the same
        designated learning institution (DLI), there is no requirement to change
        their study permit or contact IRCC to update them of the changes. There
        are, however, a few exceptions to this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the foreign national’s study permit has certain conditions listed
            on it and if these conditions will be affected by the change in
            programs, then they must contact IRCC to update them with the
            changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the foreign national switches to a program of longer duration
            than the validity of their study permit, then they will have to
            apply to extend their study permit before the original expiration
            date.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Changing Schools</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If an international student chooses to transfer institutions within the
        same level of study, then they are not required to obtain a new study
        permit, but they are required to contact IRCC and notify them of the
        change in institutions. The student must ensure that the new institution
        is a designated learning institution (DLI), since non-DLI schools are
        not eligible to host international students.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a foreign national wishes to transfer from an institution outside of
        the province of Quebec to an institution inside the province of Quebec,
        they will have to obtain a{" "}
        <italic> certificat d’acceptation du Québec </italic>(CAQ) before they
        can transfer. This is because the province of Quebec has unique
        requirements for international students.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Changing Level of Study</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on the level of study for a foreign national, it may be
        necessary to obtain a new study permit or to inform IRCC of changes.
        Below are the common changes between levels of study:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <bold>
              {" "}
              Changing from primary education to secondary education:{" "}
            </bold>
            It is not necessary to obtain a new study permit. If, in making this
            change, the student is transferring from one institution to another,
            they should contact IRCC to update their institution of study.
            <br /> <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <bold>Note: </bold>If a minor child is accompanying a parent or
                guardian who possesses a valid work or study permit, then the
                child does not require a study permit at the primary and
                secondary school levels.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br /> <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <bold>
              {" "}
              Changing from secondary education to post-secondary education:{" "}
            </bold>
            It is necessary to obtain a new study permit from IRCC when
            switching from a secondary to post-secondary level of education.
          </li>{" "}
          <br />
          <li>
            <bold>
              {" "}
              Changing from one post-secondary level to another post-secondary
              level:{" "}
            </bold>{" "}
            It is not necessary to obtain a new study permit if switching
            between different post-secondary levels of education (for example,
            from a Bachelor’s Degree to a Master’s Degree). However, if the
            student is changing schools, or if the change in programs will
            affect the duration of study and/or the conditions listed on the
            permit, then the student should take the appropriate action as
            indicated above.
