        Canada ranks among the top countries in the world for accessible,
        quality education for international students. In order to understand
        which program is right for you, first you must understand Canada’s
        levels of study.

        <sp>Elementary & Secondary Education</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        All children in Canada are required by law to attend school. Schooling
        for children begins at the age of five or six and continues at least
        until the child is 16. The school system for Canadian children begins
        with elementary school and progresses to high school (or secondary
        school). This system is composed of twelve grades. Once a person
        completes Grade 12, they receive their high school diploma which makes
        them eligible for post-secondary education (college and university).
        <br />
        <br />
        There are both private and public schools in Canada’s schooling system.
        While private schools may have specialised curriculums, programs, and
        resources, they often charge annual tuition rates for students. Public
        schools are fully funded by the Canadian government and teach
        government-mandated curriculums to their students.
        <br />
        <br />
        A Canadian student only becomes eligible to attend college or university
        once they receive their high school diploma. If a foreign national
        wishes to attend college or university in Canada, they should be able to
        demonstrate that they possess a high school diploma as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Types of Post-Secondary Education</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any educational program occurring at a level above the twelve-grade
        elementary and secondary school system is considered
        <bold> post-secondary education.</bold> There are a few different types
        of post-secondary education each with different purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>University</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A university is a post-secondary educational institution which is
        authorised to grant degrees. Every university offers Bachelor’s Degree
        programs, and many also offer Master’s Degree programs and PhD programs.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>College</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A college is a post-secondary educational institution which cannot grant
        degrees, though there are some exceptions to this. Instead, they usually
        offer programs resulting in certificates and/or diplomas. In general,
        college programs are more directly career-oriented when compared to
        universities. A college graduate may complete hands-on, practical
        training in an employable skill, like graphic design or culinary skills.
        Colleges often have courses to improve a person’s skills and
        employability, such as language training. As well, many colleges have
        training programs or apprenticeships in skilled trade occupations like
        carpentry or welding.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Trade School/Apprenticeships</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A skilled trade refers to a specialised occupation, usually emphasising
        some form of manual labour, which requires hands-on training and formal
        education. A skilled trade rarely requires a Bachelor’s Degree, so
        education in the trades usually occurs through trade schools, which are
        often smaller programs contained within colleges or vocational schools.
        As well, once an aspiring tradesperson has sufficient training, they may
        undertake an apprenticeship. As an apprentice, the student works closely
        with an experienced tradesperson to refine their skills in the trade.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Vocational School</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A vocational school may have educational programs at either the
        secondary or post-secondary level, so it is not always necessary to have
        a high school diploma in order to attend vocational school. Vocational
        programs teach students the technical skills required to perform the
        tasks of a specific job. These programs prepare students to enter
        directly into the workforce, either in skilled or low-skilled
        occupations.
        <br />
        <br />
        While there are separate terms for different types of schools at the
        post-secondary level these terms mean different things in locations
        around the world, so a college may refer to one type of school in Canada
        but something different in France. As well, sometimes these schools
        overlap, there can be colleges associated with universities, or trade
        schools within colleges.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is an Associate Degree in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In some countries, an associate degree refers to an undergraduate degree
        awarded by a college or university upon completion of a course of study
        which is usually two years in length. The only province in Canada to
        offer associate degrees is the province of British Columbia, where a
        student can complete a two-year associate degree allowing students to
        then enter a Bachelor’s Degree program at the third year of study.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of the province of British Columbia, associate degrees are not
        available, though other provinces do offer one- and two-year
        certificates and diplomas that can sometimes be transferred into
        Bachelor’s programs.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Understanding Undergraduate vs Graduate Education</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Within a university, there are different levels of degrees. All
        Bachelor’s Degree programs are considered to be undergraduate programs.
        An undergraduate program is a more general program of study, focused on
        a certain field but not necessarily specialising in a certain topic. In
        contrast, a Master’s or PhD level program is considered graduate
        education. Graduate programs are usually much smaller, highly
        specialised programs which emphasise research.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Understanding Certificate vs Diploma</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The difference between a diploma and a certificate is the length of the
        program. Both of these levels of education provide students with
        training for entry directly into a specific occupation. A certificate
        generally requires one year of full-time study at a college or
        vocational institute while a diploma generally requires two years of
        full-time study at the same type of institute. Some schools also offer
        advanced diplomas, which require the completion of at least three years
        of full-time study.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Levels of Education in Quebec</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In every province of Canada except for Quebec, elementary and secondary
        school is made up of the twelve-grade system. After a student completes
        Grade Twelve, they graduate from secondary school and receive a high
        school diploma. Only after completing high school will they become
        eligible for post-secondary studies. Quebec’s education system operates
        in a slightly different manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Quebec, elementary and secondary school is only made up of eleven
        grades. Once a person completes Grade Eleven, they receive their
        secondary school certificate. However, Quebec has another level of
        education between secondary school and undergraduate university
        programs. This level of education is called CEGEP{" "}
        <italic>(Collège d’enseignement général et professionnel).</italic>{" "}
        CEGEPs are educational institutions that allow students to select a
        program of specialisation which leads to a Diplôme d’études collégiales
        (DEC). In the CEGEP system there are two types of programs:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. Pre-University: These programs are two years in length with the
          purpose of preparing a student to continue onto a university program.
          <br />
          2. Technical: These programs are three years in length with the
          purpose of preparing a graduate to immediately enter the workforce.
        </ul>
        <br />
        Students in Quebec are only eligible to begin an undergraduate
        university program after completing a CEGEP program. However, it should
        be noted that for Quebec students, a Bachelor’s Degree usually requires
        only three years of full-time study, where the rest of Canada requires
        four years of full-time study to receive a Bachelor’s.
