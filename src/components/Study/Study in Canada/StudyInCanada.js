        <br />
        <sp>Why should I study in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Why do international students find Canada so appealing? Firstly,
        Canada’s reputation as a safe and stable country is a significant
        factor. Secondly, the high-quality education system, known for its
        excellence and diversity, is a major draw. Lastly, Canada’s inclusive
        and tolerant society plays a pivotal role in the decision-making
        process.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, international students are looking toward the future while
        in Canada. An impressive 72.5% of them plan to apply for a post-graduate
        work permit, which allows them to gain valuable work experience.
        Additionally, 60% of these students aspire to make Canada their
        permanent home, highlighting the country’s attractiveness as a place not
        only for studying but also for building a promising future. With its
        welcoming environment, outstanding education system, and diverse
        opportunities, Canada’s appeal to international students has never been
        stronger.

        <bold>1. Choose a Program: </bold>Your program choice is one of the most
        important factors of your study permit application. You must present a

        <sp>What is a Canadian Study Permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A Canadian study permit is the document that allows you to study at a
        school in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you have been accepted to study at a Designated Learning
        Institution (DLI), you can apply for a Canadian study permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is the Application Process for a Canadian Study Permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are four stages to obtaining a Canadian study permit:
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>1. Check your eligibility: </bold>Ensure you meet the eligibility
        requirements for a Canadian study permit. You will need:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>an acceptance letter from a DLI,</li>
          <li>proof of financial support,</li>
          <li>
            supporting documents (varies depending on your countries of
            citizenship and residence)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>2. Prepare your application: </bold>If you meet all eligibility
        requirements then you can start to prepare your study permit
        application. Make sure that you have gathered all documents required for
        your country. If you don’t show that you meet the requirements, an
        immigration officer may reject your application. It is a good idea to
        have a qualified immigration representative review your application
        before you submit it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>3. Submit your study permit application: </bold>You have two
        options when submitting your application:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Submit an electronic application: Create an account on the
            Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website. You can
            submit an application electronically using scanned or electronic
            copies of documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submit a paper-based application: Gather hard copies of your
            documents and mail them to the Visa Application Centre (VAC)
            assigned to your country.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <bold>4. If your study permit is approved, come to Canada! </bold>You do
        not receive your Canadian study permit until you arrive at a Canadian
        Port of Entry (POE). If your permit is approved, the Canadian government
        will issue you a Port of Entry Introduction Letter. You must show this
        letter to the immigration official when you arrive in Canada to get your
        study permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How Long Does it Take to Apply for a Canadian Study Permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Processing times for study permits vary greatly. The amount of time it
        takes depends on your country of residence.
        <br />
        <br />
        The shortest processing time is <bold>1-2 weeks,</bold> but some
        applicants can expect to wait as long as<bold> 16 weeks.</bold>{" "}
        Processing times depend on the volume of applications received. If
        you’re applying close to the beginning of Canada’s academic year you may
        experience delays.
        <br />
        <br />
        Note: Students from India have the option for applying under SDS.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What Are the Conditions of a Canadian Study Permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are certain terms and conditions attached to a Canadian study
        permit. You must respect these conditions in order to retain all the
        benefits of your study experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            You must be enrolled at a designated learning institution (DLI)
          </li>
          <li>
            You must be enrolled as a part-time student, or a full-time student
            if studying in Quebec
          </li>
          <li>
            You must not take any authorised leaves longer than 150 days from
            your program of study
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        It is important to understand and respect the terms of your study
        permit. In doing so, you will get the most out of your study abroad
        experience in Canada. Students who respect the terms of their study
        permits also have a better chance of being granted a post-graduate work
        permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How Much Does it Cost to Study in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The good news is that studying in Canada is affordable. Canadian tuition
        fees are generally lower than those in Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the 2018/2019 school year, the average annual tuition for an
        undergraduate international student in Canada was $27,159 CAD. The
        average tuition for the same year spent at an American university can be
        compared at $45,950 USD.
        <br />
        <br />
        When deciding where to study abroad, cost of living is also an important
        factor to consider. The cost of living in Canada can be very affordable
        compared to most other top destinations for international students.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How to Study in Canada for Free</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are plenty of scholarship opportunities for international students
        who want to study in Canada. The opportunities available to you will
        depend on your field of study or research and your country of origin.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A designated learning institution (DLI) is any school that is allowed to
        admit international students.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>All primary and secondary schools in Canada are DLIs</bold> and
        can admit students from foreign countries.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Not all post-secondary schools are DLIs,</bold> so you must check
        the Canadian government’s list of DLIs before applying.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          What are the Different Types of Canadian Post-Secondary Schools?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada has a reputation for providing accessible, quality education for
        international students. To understand which program is right for you,
        first you must understand Canada’s levels of study.
        <br />
        <br />
        Any educational program beyond the twelfth grade in Canada is considered
        post-secondary education. There are a few different types of
        post-secondary education, each with a different purpose. Certain
        programs may have specific admissions requirements. Our mandate is to
        ensure that you meet the basic admissions requirements for any program
        that you are applying for
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Do I Need to Take the IELTS to Study in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To study at a Canadian school you will need to be proficient in English
        or French.
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian post-secondary schools set their own conditions for language
        skills of international students. Language skill requirements vary from
        one school to the next.
        <br />
        <br />
        While preparing your application, you should research the specific
        requirements for your program. Some schools even allow you to complete
        English courses after you begin your studies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some international students do not need to provide proof of their
        language skills. If you are from an English-speaking country or have
        studied in English, then you may not have to take the IELTS.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each school set its own language requirements. It is important to check
        the specific requirements of the school where you want to apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Do I Need to Submit a Letter of Intent to Study in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Your letter of intent is a critical part of your study permit
        application. It should explain your plans to study in the country and
        your goals. You should acknowledge the conditions of being a Canadian
        study permit-holder.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of the letter of intent is to assure the Canadian government
        that you will respect the conditions of your permit. You must agree to
        leave the country once your permit has expired. Our international
        student program offers guidance on writing your best letter of intent!
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>When is the Deadline to Apply?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Each school has their own deadline. You should make sure to submit your
        application well before this deadline.
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian schools are flooded with applications every year. As the
        deadline approaches, schools become more selective. The more reputable
        schools are especially competitive, so the earlier you get your
        application in, the better.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I Change Schools or Programs While on a Study Permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        With a Canadian study permit, you can change your school or program at
        any time. To do so, you will want to make sure you are following the
        right procedure and staying within the conditions of your study permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here are the exact steps you need to follow to change your school or
        program through the online portal:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. Sign in to your account.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Find the section called
          <bold> Designated Learning Institution student transfer</bold>
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Click<bold> transfer from DLI number</bold>
          <br />
          <br />
          4. Enter your study permit application number in the search field and
          then click<bold> search for my application</bold>
          <br />
          <br />
          5. You may be prompted to enter more details from your original study
          permit application, so it’s important to have this handy.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. Enter the information about your new program or school, including
          the new DLI number, your new student ID number, and your start date.
          <br />
          <br />
          7. Click<bold> submit transfer</bold>
          <br />
          <br />
          8. You will then be asked to review all the information you have
          submitted. If everything looks good, you can complete the process by
          clicking<bold> confirm transfer</bold>
          <br />
          <br />
          9. You will receive a notification that your request is complete. This
          confirms that you have successfully informed the government of your
          change in plans.
          <br />
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Can I Work While Studying in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes! Another perk to studying in Canada is that international students
        have the right to work. This helps offset the cost of tuition and living
        expenses. <br />
        <br />
        International students in Canada can work part-time (up to 20 hours per
        week) during school terms. During scheduled breaks like summer vacation,
        international students may work full-time. <br />
        <br />
        Most students don’t need a work permit to work while they study, whether
        their job is on campus or off campus. Your study permit will state
        whether you’re allowed to work off campus. <br />
        <br />
        If your program of study includes work experience, you may be able to
        work more than 20 hours during the semester. This will be indicated in
        your letter of acceptance. If the government approves this condition,
        you will be granted both a work permit and a study permit. This work
        permit will allow you to work on campus only. <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I Bring My Family With Me While I Study?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        International students who are married or have kids may wish to bring
        their family with them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian visa officers will consider study permit applications which
        include accompanying family members. You should note that including
        family members on a study permit application may influence the visa
        officer’s decision.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are approved as a family, your spouse will be able to work full
        time while in Canada. Any accompanying children will be able to study
        for free.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can My Spouse Work While I am Studying in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If your family does accompany you, your spouse will be eligible for an
        open work permit, authorising them to work full-time in Canada while you
        are studying.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I Study in Quebec?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Studying in Quebec gives you the option to study in English, French, or
        both. However, Quebec student visa requirements are a little different
        from the rest of Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What Are the Requirements to Study in Quebec?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to study in Quebec, you will need a Quebec Acceptance
        Certificate (CAQ). This document is issued by the Ministry of
        Immigration, Francisation and Integration (MIFI). It confirms that
        Quebec has accepted you as an international student. You need a CAQ
        before you can apply for a study permit if your program of study is in
        Québec.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be eligible to apply for a CAQ, you need to meet the following
        requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Be accepted into a Québec designated learning institution</li>
          <li>Pay the fees associated with a CAQ application</li>
          <li>
            Agree to comply with the conditions for issuing a CAQ for studies{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        You do not need a CAQ or a study permit if you intend to study a program
        that is less than 6 months in duration.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you have a CAQ, you have to apply for a study permit from the
        Government of Canada. When you receive your study permit, you’re ready
        to start studying in Canada!

          Are International Students Covered by Canada’s Healthcare System?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        All international students in Canada must have healthcare coverage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Certain provinces allow international students access to Canada’s public
        healthcare system. Students in provinces that do not offer health
        coverage must buy private health insurance. All Canadian schools offer
        health insurance plans for international students.

        <sp>Can I Stay in Canada After I Graduate?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada makes it easy for international students to become permanent
        residents if they want to remain in the country.

          </a>
        </bold>
        allows international students to stay in Canada and work for up to three
        years after graduating. After working in Canada for one year,
        international graduates may be eligible to apply for permanent
        residency.

        To apply for a PGWP, you need to prove that you have respected all the
        conditions of your study permit. Studying must have been your primary
        activity during your time in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        A PGWP is typically granted for the same duration as your studies in
        Canada.
