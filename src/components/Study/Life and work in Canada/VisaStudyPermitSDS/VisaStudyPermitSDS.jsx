              Canada Study Permit / Student Direct Stream (SDS) in Canada
            </div>

            <div class="pages-paragraph space-fix intro-size-fix">
              Canada is one of the most popular destinations for international
              students due to its world-class education and pathways to
              permanent residency. To study in Canada, international students
              need a study permit, which act as a student visa. Canada also
              introduced the Student Direct Stream (SDS) program in 2018 to
              expedite the visa application process. This program processed
              application within 20 days for eligible students from countries
              including India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.
              <div className="pages-paragraph">
                However, as of November 8, 2024, the SDS program was
                discontinued, making the study permit application process more
                aligned with the general immigration process. The decision to
                end the SDS aims to ensure equitable access to the study permit
                application process for all international students. Applicants
                will now be required to obtain a Provincial Attestation Letter
                (PAL) from their chosen province or territory as part of their
                application. The financial requirements for students have also
                increased, with proof of funds now set at CA$ 20,635 to cover
                living expenses during their studies. This article will explain
                the nuances of the study permit, the now-closed SDS, and what
                international students can expect moving forward.

              A study permit is the official document that allows foreign
              nationals to study in Canada at a Designated Learning Institution
              (DLI). While it is often referred to as a student visa, the study
              permit is, in fact, a permit issued to international students to
              legally study in Canada for the duration of their academic
              program. Students also require a temporary resident visa (TRV) or
              electronic travel authorization (eTA), depending on their country
              of origin, in order to enter Canada.

              To be eligible for a study permit in Canada, prospective
              international students must meet several requirements:

                </li>

                <li>
                  Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient funds to
                  cover tuition fees, living expenses, and return transportation
                  to their home country. This typically includes:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) of approximately
                      CAD 20,635.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Proof of payment for at least the first year of tuition

                </li>

                <li>
                  Students must provide evidence of proficiency in English or
                  French, depending on the language of instruction.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Accepted tests include IELTS, TOEFL, or French-language

                </li>

                <li>
                  In some cases, students may need to provide a police

              Student Direct Stream (SDS)
            </div>
            <div class="pages-paragraph">
              The Student Direct Stream (SDS) was a fast-track application
              process introduced by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada
              (IRCC) in 2018. The program was aimed at international students
              from 14 select countries, including India, China, the Philippines,
              and Pakistan. SDS allowed eligible students to get faster study
              permit processing times — typically within 20 days — which was a
              significant improvement over the standard study permit processing
              time of up to 8 weeks.
              <div className="my-2">
                This streamlined process made Canada an even more attractive
                destination for students from these countries, particularly
                India, where approximately 70% of applicants used the SDS route.

                <li>
                  One of the biggest advantages of the SDS was the significantly
                  reduced processing time, often as short as 20 days, compared
                  to the standard processing time of up to 8 weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The SDS program had higher approval rates compared to the
                  regular study permit route. This was partly due to the
                  specific requirements, including the need for strong financial
                  evidence and language proficiency, which helped ensure that
                  only well-prepared students applied through the SDS.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The SDS process had more specific guidelines for financial
                  proof, making it clearer and more predictable for students to
                  meet the financial requirements.

              Effective November 8, 2024, the SDS program has officially closed.
              This decision marks a significant shift in how international
              students apply for study permits. According to the Immigration,
              Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the closure of the SDS is
              part of a broader strategy to regulate the influx of international
              students, manage housing pressures, and ensure fair access to the
              study permit process for all applicants.

              The closure of the SDS program will have several consequences for
              students, particularly those from India and other countries that
              historically benefited from the expedited process:
              <ul className="my-2 ml-3">
                <li>
                  Students who previously used the SDS route can expect longer
                  processing times under the standard study permit application
                  process, which may take up to 8 weeks or more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Financial documentation will continue to play a critical role
                  in the approval process. However, the stricter proof of funds
                  requirements may present challenges for students from
                  lower-income families, especially in the absence of the more
                  streamlined SDS procedures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While the SDS had a high approval rate, students applying
                  through the standard process may face a more stringent review,
                  potentially leading to lower approval rates.

            Implications for Indian Students

            <div class="pages-paragraph">
            Indian students, who have historically accounted for a significant portion of international students in Canada, will face unique challenges with the closure of the SDS program. As of recent statistics, India represents around 34% of Canada’s international student population, and the majority of these students used the SDS route for its faster processing and higher approval rates.
            <div className="my-2">With the closure of SDS, Indian students can expect:</div>
              <ul className="my-2 ml-3">
                <li>
                 <strong>Longer wait times: </strong>The shift from the expedited 20-day processing timeline to potentially up to 8 weeks will require more patience and planning.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Stricter financial documentation: </strong>Proving sufficient funds may become more challenging, as students will no longer benefit from the simplified SDS requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Greater competition: </strong>With no expedited route available, the study permit application process will likely become more competitive, leading to potentially more scrutiny on applications.
                </li>
              </ul>

              The closure of the Student Direct Stream (SDS) represents a significant shift in the Canadian study permit application process. While the move may be seen as a measure to balance demand and ensure fair access for all international students, it undoubtedly creates challenges for students, especially those from countries like India that relied heavily on the program. However, Canada remains a top destination for international students, and with thorough preparation, students can still successfully navigate the regular study permit process. It's crucial for prospective applicants to be aware of the changes, stay informed, and prepare their applications well in advance to avoid any delays in their educational journey.
