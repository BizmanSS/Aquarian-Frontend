              Admission to study in Canada has become an increasingly popular
              choice for international students, with the country hosting over 1
              million students, marking a 29% increase from the previous year.
              This surge reflects Canada's reputation for high-quality
              education, affordability, and a welcoming multicultural
              environment. International students now represent a significant
              portion of the student population in Canada, accounting for 23% of
              postsecondary enrolments in provinces like Ontario.
              <div className="pages-paragraph">
                Canadian institutions offer a wide range of programs across
                diverse fields, attracting students from around the globe.
                Notably, students from India and China have historically made up
                a large percentage of the international student body. However,
                navigating the admissions process can be challenging, especially
                with recent changes like the Canadian government’s cap on
                international student applications.
