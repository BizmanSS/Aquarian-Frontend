        <br />
        <sp>What is a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC)?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A GIC is a Canadian investment that has a guaranteed rate of return for
        a fixed period of time. Many banks offer GICs. The bank that gives you
        the GIC must:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            confirm that you bought a GIC by giving you 1 of the following:
            <ul>
              <li>a letter of attestation</li>
              <li>a GIC certificate</li>
              <li> an Investment Directions Confirmation or</li>
              <li>an Investment Balance Confirmation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            hold the GIC in an investment account or a student account that you
            can’t access until you arrive in Canada
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>confirm your identity before they release any funds to you</li>
        </ul>
        Once you arrive in Canada, you will receive a portion of your GIC. The
        rest will be paid out to you over the next 10 to 12 months.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your bank or GIC doesn’t meet these criteria, you won’t be able to
        apply through the Student Direct Stream.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Where can I get a GIC?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can get a GIC from a financial institution listed on the Canadian
        Deposit Insurance Company website. Make sure the financial institution
        you choose offers a GIC and meets the criteria for the Student Direct
        Stream.
        <br />
        <br />
        The following financial institutions offer GICs that meet the criteria:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Bank of Beijing</li>
          <li>Bank of China</li>

        <sp>Can my family come with me through SDS Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes. Your spouse, partner, and dependent children may come with you when
        you apply through SDS Canada! <br />
        <br />
        They may also be eligible for faster processing times when submitting
        applications for work permits, study permits, or visitor visas. <br />
        <br />
        All family members must complete and submit their applications at the
        same time. When you apply online, indicate that you have family members
        coming with you to Canada. This lets you complete their applications at
        the same time as yours.

        <sp>How to Apply to Canada’s Student Direct Stream (SDS)</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The only way to apply for a study permit through SDS is online. This
        instruction guide can help you to fill out the necessary forms. <br />
        <br />
        <bold>You will also need:</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A scanner or camera to submit electronic copies of your documents{" "}
          </li>{" "}
          <li>A credit or debit card in order to make a payment</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Remember, a study permit is NOT a visa. You may still need a visitor
        visa or an electronic travel authorization (eTA) in order to enter
        Canada. This will be issued to you by the federal government along with
        your study permit.

        <br />
        <sp>Can I get Canadian permanent residence through SDS Canada?</sp>{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada makes it easy for international students to become permanent
        residents if they want to remain in the country.
        <br />
        <br />
        The <bold>Post-Graduate Work Permit</bold> allows international students
        to stay in Canada and work for up to three years after graduating. After
        working in Canada for one year, international graduates may be eligible
        to apply for permanent residency.
