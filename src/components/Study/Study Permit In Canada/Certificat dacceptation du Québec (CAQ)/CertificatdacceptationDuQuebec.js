        The province of Quebec is unique in the landscape of Canadian
        immigration. The federal government has granted Quebec significantly
        more autonomy in the conduct of immigration policies and procedures,
        which is why Quebec’s immigration programs are often treated separately
        from the other provinces.

        A number of Quebec’s temporary resident programs require a certificat
        d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ), or Quebec Acceptance Certificate, to
        authorise stay in Quebec.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Did you know?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />A Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) authorises
        <bold> temporary </bold>stay in the Province of Quebec. Not to be
        confused with a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ), which authorises
        permanent stay in the province.
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals interested in attending a post-secondary institution
        in the province of Quebec have to complete an extra step compared to all
        other provinces and territories in Canada. If a foreign national wishes
        to study in Quebec for a period longer than 6 months, they must obtain a
        CAQ. Foreign nationals are only eligible to submit a study permit
        application after they have obtained a CAQ. But there is also some cases
        when a CAQ is not necessary.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Apply for a CAQ</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Below are the step-by-step instructions a foreign national may follow to
        obtain a certificat d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ):
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <bold>1. Letter of Acceptance </bold>In order to apply for a CAQ, a
          foreign national must first demonstrate that they have been accepted
          into a program of study at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)
          located in the province of Quebec. This is demonstrated through an
          acceptance letter, an official document issued by the institution
          attesting to the student’s acceptance into a study program.
          <br /> <br />
          <bold>2. CAQ Documents </bold>In order to prepare a CAQ application, a
          foreign national must first determine which documents are required.
          Document requirements vary significantly depending on an applicant’s
          personal situation and country of citizenship. Country-specific
          requirements are listed on the Immigration Quebec website. Be very
          careful to ensure that your application is complete because any
          incorrect information or missing documents could result in the refusal
          of a CAQ, jeopardising your chances of success.
          <br /> <br />
          <bold>3. CAQ Application </bold>When a foreign national is ready to
          submit their CAQ, they can complete the application using the
          Immigration Quebec web portal. They must enter the required
          information and pay the application fees using a credit. Once the
          payment is submitted, the foreign national must print the application,
          sign it, and mail it in hard copy to the Ministère de l’Immigration,
          de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion (MIDI). Please note: Only original
          signatures are accepted on CAQ applications. Any application submitted
          without an original signature will be refused.
          <br /> <br />
          <bold>4. After CAQ is Received </bold>Once an applicant successfully
          receives their CAQ, they must apply for a study permit from Canada’s
          federal government. Other than under exceptional circumstances,
          foreign nationals will not be authorised to participate in studies in
          Canada unless they have a valid study permit. Please note: Processing
          times for CAQs vary depending on the applicant’s country of
          citizenship and the volume of applications received by MIDI. Foreign
          nationals are advised to plan in advance to ensure they have adequate
          time to receive their CAQ and study permit before their intended start
          date.
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>CAQ Requirements</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        When applying for a CAQ, an applicant must ensure that they meet all
        requirements outlined by the Quebec immigration agency, le Ministère de
        l’Immigration, de la Diversité et de l’Inclusion (MIDI). The following
        are general requirements for staying in Quebec as an international
        student, though it should be noted that the exact requirements may vary
        from person to person. To obtain a CAQ for an educational program in
        Quebec, a foreign national must:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Possess an acceptance letter from a DLI in Quebec</li>
          <li>Pay all application fees for the processing of a CAQ</li>
          <li>Commit to making studies their principal activity</li>
          <li>
            Ensure that they have health and hospitalisation insurance for the
            duration of their stay*
          </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrate sufficient means of financial support to cover tuition
            costs and cost of living while residing in Quebec**
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        * Most educational institutions will offer health insurance packages to
        their students. ** Some applicants are exempt from this requirement.
        <br />
