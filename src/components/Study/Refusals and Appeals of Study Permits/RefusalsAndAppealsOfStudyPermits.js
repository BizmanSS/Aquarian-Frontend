        In order to study in Canada, the majority of foreign nationals require a
        study permit. The issuance of study permits is approved at the
        discretion of Canadian immigration officers. Unfortunately, it is common
        for a study permit to be refused to a foreign national for a variety of
        reasons. In the event that a study permit is refused, a visa officer
        will issue the refusal in a letter outlining the grounds for refusal.

        OVERCOME YOUR STUDY PERMIT REFUSAL
        <br />
        <br />
        If a foreign national is refused a study permit by Immigration, Refugees
        and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), there are two courses of action for
        addressing the refusal:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. <bold>Appeal the decision: </bold>If the applicant believes that
          their application met all requirements as mandated by IRCC, but the
          study permit was refused unfairly or incorrectly, the foreign national
          can appeal the decision and request a reconsideration.
          <br />
          2. <bold>Submit a new application: </bold>If the applicant believes
          that the grounds for refusal are valid, then their only course of
          action is to submit a new application. In the new application they
          should pay careful attention to address the previous grounds for
          refusal. As well, if any documents need to be updated (start date on
          acceptance letter, updated bank statements, etc.) the applicant should
          be sure to obtain these updates.
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>What to do if Your Application is Refused</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        When a study permit application is refused, this refusal will be noted
        in a letter issued by the visa officer to the unsuccessful applicant.
        Within this letter, the visa officer will indicate the reason(s) for
        refusal from a list of pre-determined possibilities. This listing of
        refusal reasons gives only basic information regarding the grounds for
        the refusal.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, when an application is refused,
        <bold>
          {" "}
          the applicant has the right to request the visa officer’s notes
          supporting the reason for refusal.{" "}
        </bold>
        It is strongly recommended that these notes are requested as this will
        inform the applicant as to how best to address the refusal. Once an
        applicant has obtained the case notes from the visa officer, they can
        assess whether or not the grounds for the refusal were valid. If the
        study permit was refused for valid reasons, for example, if the
        applicant failed to include any of the required documents, then the best
        option is to submit a new application after ensuring that the errors are
        addressed.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the study permit was refused for reasons the applicant believes were
        invalid, then an appeal requesting reconsideration may be submitted.
        Both the appeal process and the resubmission process may take
        considerable amounts of time. The applicant should therefore be prepared
        to contact their school to request amendments to their intended start
        date in the event that they will not be able to obtain a study permit in
        time to begin the program on the date originally planned.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Reasons for Refusal</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are many reasons why a Canadian study permit application may be
        refused. These reasons will be indicated on the refusal letter issued by
        IRCC. A foreign national may also request case notes from the visa
        officer who reviewed their file in order to better understand the
        grounds for refusal. Below are the most common reasons why a study
        permit may be refused:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. <bold>IRCC Questions Your Proof of Financial Support : </bold>When
          you submit a study permit application, you need to demonstrate that
          you have sufficient funds to support yourself in Canada. IRCC mandates
          that all international students prove they have the funds to cover
          their tuition fees for the first year of study, as well as the cost of
          living for themselves and any accompanying family members.

              How do you address a problem with proof of financial support?{" "}
            </bold>
          </italic>
          If your application is refused because IRCC questions your ability to
          financially support yourself, you should carefully review the
          financial documents you submitted with your application. Make sure
          that you address the concerns raised by the visa officer and submit
          additional documents to prove that you meet the proof of funds
          requirement.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. <bold>
            IRCC Questions Your Intention to Leave the Country :{" "}
          </bold>{" "}
          A study permit is a temporary visa, which means that it has a validity
          period and an expiration date. In your study permit application, you
          need to convince the visa officer that you will leave the country when
          your study permit expires. That does not mean that you cannot apply to
          extend your study permit, or stay permanently. In fact, there are many
          programs designed by the government to help students stay and work in
          Canada following their studies, or transition to permanent residence.
          What it does mean is that the visa officer has to trust that you will
          not stay in the country illegally when you are out of status. Usually,
          this is a problem if you don’t demonstrate that you have good reasons
          to want to return home.
          <br />
          <br />
          <italic>
            <bold>How to address a problem of intent? </bold>
          </italic>
          The best way to address this concern is through your personal
          statement. If the visa officer isn’t convinced of the narrative you’ve
          provided, you need to rework your statement to try to address their
          concerns directly. Note: It is possible to actively pursue both
          permanent and temporary residence in Canada. This is done by claiming
          dual intent in an application.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. <bold>IRCC Questions Your Choice of Study Program :</bold>Study
          permit applications are sometimes refused if the visa officer doesn’t
          understand the logic of your choice of program or level of study.
          Someone with a Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing from the Philippines and
          four years of experience working as a nurse who wants to study hotel
          management, for example, could be questioned. The chosen program in
          Canada doesn’t seem to align very well with the applicant’s
          educational background or employment history.
          <br />
          <br />
          <italic>
            <bold>How to address a problem with choice of program? </bold>
          </italic>{" "}
          If your choice of program seems odd, given your past education or work
          experience, you need to clearly explain why you want to study it in
          your personal statement. This is another case where seeing the visa
          officer’s notes can really help.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. <bold> IRCC Questions Your Acceptance Letter : </bold>Before you
          can apply for a study permit, you have to obtain a letter of
          acceptance from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) in Canada. You
          also have to meet all program requirements. If the visa officer doubts
          that your letter of acceptance is genuine, or that you have actually
          met the program requirements, they might refuse your study permit.
          <br />

          <italic>
            <bold>How to address a problem with an acceptance letter? </bold>
          </italic>{" "}
          Review the school documents that you submitted. Make sure that all of
          the documents are clear and easy to read, and provide any additional
          supporting documents that you can. In some events, you may want to
          contact the DLI that issued the document for help addressing the
          officer’s concerns.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. <bold> IRCC Questions Your Travel or Identity Documents :</bold> If
          you don’t have a complete record of your travel history, or if your
          identity documents are unclear, IRCC may refuse your study permit
          application. IRCC must be able to verify your identity to determine
          whether you are medically or criminally inadmissible to Canada.

              How to address problems with travel or identity documents?{" "}
            </bold>
          </italic>
          If the visa officer thinks there are blank spaces in your travel
          history, review the documents you submitted and the visa officer’s
          notes to find which time periods are problematic. When you re-apply,
          be sure to include additional supporting evidence to cover these
          periods. If the problem is with your identity documents, review your
          application to make sure that they were clear and easy to read.
