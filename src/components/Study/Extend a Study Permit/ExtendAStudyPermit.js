        Most foreign nationals wishing to study in Canada must have a valid
        study permit. In the event that an international student will take
        longer than expected to complete their program of study, or if they
        transfer to a longer program of study, there is a strong likelihood that
        they will have to apply to extend their study permit.

        A study permit extension is required if an international student in
        Canada wishes to continue studying for longer than the validity period
        of their study permit. To extend the permit, the international student
        must submit an application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
        Canada (IRCC) to extend their stay in Canada as a student.
        <br />
        <br />
        This application must be submitted electronically unless otherwise
        specified. The Canadian government requires that most temporary
        residence applications made from within Canada be made through
        electronic application, including:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            all applications for extensions of temporary resident status made
            from within Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            all applications for study or work permits made from within Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            all applications for renewals of study or work permits made from
            within Canada
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The student should plan ahead to ensure this application is submitted in
        advance of the expiration date of their current permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        As long as the application is submitted before this date they will be
        authorised to remain in Canada as a student through implied status until
        a decision is made on the extension application, so long as the
        conditions of their permit have not changed. However, if the conditions
        of the permit have changed, then the foreign national does not have
        implied status and must wait until they receive a decision on their
        application.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a student fails to apply for a study permit extension before their
        permit expires, they can apply for a restoration of status for up to 90
        days following the expiration. If a foreign national wants to change
        their study permit, such as changing levels of study, transferring
        institutions, or altering conditions listed on their study permit, then
        it may not be sufficient to simply apply to extend their study permit.
        In these cases, it may be necessary to apply for a new study permit.

        <sp>Temporary Resident Visa (TRV)</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Any foreign national from a country that requires a visa to enter Canada
        should be aware that there is a high likelihood that their Temporary
        Resident Visa (TRV) will expire on the same date as their study permit.
        Maintaining a valid TRV is not mandatory for a foreign national studying
        in Canada, since it is the study permit which grants authority to
        participate in study activities. However, the TRV authorises entry and
        re-entry to Canada. If you intend to travel outside Canada during the
        course of your studies, you may need to renew your TRV.

        In the province of Quebec, international students must possess both a

        international student wishes to continue their studies after the expiry
        date indicated on their CAQ, then they must apply for a new CAQ from the
