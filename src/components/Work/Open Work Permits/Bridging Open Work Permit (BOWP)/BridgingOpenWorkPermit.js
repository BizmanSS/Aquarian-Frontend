        <sp>What is a bridging open work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP) allows foreign nationals who are
        currently working in Canada to extend their status while awaiting a
        decision on their permanent residency application. The BOWP is only
        available to those who have submitted a permanent residency application
        and are already in possession of a valid work permit. A successful BOWP
        application results in an open work permit, enabling the holder to work
        for multiple employers in multiple locations, of their own choosing.

        <br />
        <br />

        fee, and $100 CAD for the open work permit holder fee.

        <sp>Bridging open work permit processing time</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Bridging open work permits are typically processed within 3-4 months.

        <sp>
          Can I apply for a bridging open work permit from outside of Canada?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals must be residing in Canada to apply for a BOWP.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Why was my bridging open work permit rejected?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        One common reason that a BOWP is refused is if applicants submit an
        incomplete permanent residence application. As applications for
        permanent residence must be passed the completeness check as part of the
        eligibility requirement, incomplete applications may result in a BOWP
        refusal.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I work while waiting for a bridging open work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />A foreign national is required to submit a BOWP application before
        their current work permit expires. If their current work permit expires
        before they have received a decision regarding their BOWP application,
        they may continue to work in Canada under
        <bold> maintained status </bold>until a final decision has been issued
        regarding the BOWP application. However, if the BOWP application is
        denied, the foreign national must cease working in Canada immediately.
        If a foreign national works in Canada without a valid work permit, they
        will jeopardise all future applications for Canadian immigration.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can a bridging open work permit be extended?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If a permanent residence application is not finalised by the time a BOWP
        expires, IRCC may issue extensions of 12 months.
