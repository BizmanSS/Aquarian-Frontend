        If your spouse is currently working or studying in Canada, or if you
        have applied to be sponsored for permanent residence by your spouse or
        partner in Canada, you may be eligible for an open work permit.

        If a foreign national is successful in their work permit application,
        they will be issued an open work permit authorising them to work for
        multiple employers in any location in Canada while their permanent
        residency application is processing, or while their spouse has valid
        status in Canada. The application procedure for the spousal sponsorship
        open work permit varies depending on the applicant’s status in Canada or
        the stage of their permanent residency application. Foreign nationals
        cannot work in Canada without the appropriate authorization. Engaging in
        any form of employment in Canada without the proper work permit is
        unlawful and can jeopardise future immigration applications.

        <br />
        <sp>What is a spouse open work permit?</sp> <br />
        <br />
        A spouse open work permit allows the spouse of certain temporary
        Canadian permit holders to work anywhere in Canada, for any employer,
        with few restrictions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Who can apply for a spouse open work permit?</sp> <br />
        <br />
        Individuals who have applied to be sponsored by their spouse, or those
        whose spouses are in Canada on a study or work permit may be able to
        apply for a spousal open work permit. The requirements for applying for
        a spousal open work permit depend on the type of status your spouse has
        in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          Can I apply for an open work permit if my spouse or partner has
          applied to sponsor me?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to be eligible to apply for a spousal sponsorship open work
        permit, a foreign national must have applied for permanent residency
        sponsorship from within Canada through the in Canada stream of the
        spousal sponsorship program.
        <br />
        <br />A foreign national must have valid status in Canada (visitor,
        student, worker, etc.) in order to submit a work permit application at
        the same time as their permanent residence application. If an applicant
        is out of status in Canada, they must wait until their permanent
        residence application has received approval in principle to submit their
        work permit application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Eligibility requirements for a spousal work permit and visa</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to qualify for a spousal open work permit, you must meet
        certain minimum requirements, including:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Must be in a genuine relationship with a qualifying foreign national
            principal applicant, permanent resident, or citizen;{" "}
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            Must be eligible to apply as the spouse of a qualifying foreign
            national, or as an in Canada sponsorship applicant (see above); and{" "}
          </li>{" "}
          <li>Are not criminally or medically inadmissible to Canada</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Additional criteria will vary depending on the category of SOWP you are
        applying under.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How long does a spouse's open work permit take to process?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The processing time for a spousal open work permit will depend on what
        type of permit your spouse applied for. To check the approximate
        processing time for a particular application, visit Canada’s dedicated
        webpage.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can a spouse's open work permit be extended?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />A SOWP is tied to the permit of the spouse, or ‘lead applicant’,
        and will only be valid for as long as the lead applicant’s permit. If
        your SOWP expires, you will need to reapply based on your spouse’s
        permit.

        <br />
        <sp>Spouse open work permit fees</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The fee for a spouse open work permit is $255 CAD – $155 for the
        processing fee, and $100 CAD for the open work permit holder fee.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How to apply for a spouse open work permit</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The spouse open work permit application procedure will differ depending
        on which type of spouse open work permit you need. The first step is
        determining which work permit is best for you. If you need help figuring
        out the application, simply contact us and a member of our team will
        assist you with scheduling a consultation.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Spousal open work permit proof of funds requirement</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Spousal open work permit candidates should be able to demonstrate that
        they have sufficient funds for their stay in Canada. If an officer is
        not convinced that an applicant will be able to support themselves while
        in Canada, this may result in a refusal.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How to renew your spouse open work permit</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        It is not possible to renew a spousal open work permit. If your permit
        expires, but your spouse or partner still has eligible status in Canada,
        you may re-apply for a new SOWP.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Why was my spouse's open work permit refused?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the main reasons spousal open work permits are refused is that
        the applicant is unable to demonstrate sufficient proof of their
        relationship to their eligible spouse. If your application was refused,
        contact us to learn more about your options.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What happens if my spouse's open work permit is refused?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If your spousal open work permit is refused, you may be eligible to
        re-apply. You should only re-apply if you can provide additional
        information or documentation to address the reason or refusal. Contact
        us to learn more about your options.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          Can I stay in Canada if my visitor permit expires while waiting for my
          SOWP to process?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you applied for In-Canada sponsorship on a visitor permit that is
        expiring, and you have applied for a spousal open work permit, you will
        be on maintained status. This means you can remain in Canada without a
        valid permit under the same conditions while awaiting a decision on your
        SOWP application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Reasons spouse open work permit are rejected</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are many reasons a spousal open work permit may be rejected. Here
        are six of the most common reasons:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. Principal applicant is living outside Canada <br />
          2. No evidence that your spouse is attending a DLI <br />
          3. Lacking proof of funds <br />
          4. Missing proof of employment <br />
          5. Insufficient ties to home country
          <br />
          6. Absence of proof of a genuine relationship
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>
          What happens to my spouse’s open work permit application if my spouse
          and I separate or divorce?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you and your spouse divorce or your common-law relationship ends
        after you’ve received your spousal open work permit, your permit will
        not be revoked. However, if your relationship ends while your
        application is still processing, you must inform IRCC of your updated
        relationship status, and will no longer be eligible for a SOWP.
