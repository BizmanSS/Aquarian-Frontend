            The Canada Open Work Permit is a flexible immigration option that allows foreign nationals to work for any employer in Canada without the need for a specific job offer. This permit is part of Canadaâ€™s broader immigration strategy to attract skilled workers, enhance labor mobility, and support family unity. An open work permit is not tied to any single location or employer. These permits are typically granted through several immigration programs, including:
