        Any foreign national wishing to work in Canada must have the proper
        authorization. For the vast majority of foreign nationals, this
        authorization comes in the form of a valid work permit. Though, it
        should be noted that there certain exemptions to the work permit
        requirements.

        A work permit is a legal document permitting a foreign national to
        engage in employment while inside of Canada. An open work permit refers
        to a work permit which is not tied to a single employer or location.
        This means that a foreign national with a valid open work permit may
        work for multiple employers in multiple locations throughout Canada. It
        should be noted that certain open work permits may have additional
        requirements or restrictions which must be respected by foreign
        nationals. Open work permits are most commonly issued through the
        following immigration programs:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Post-Graduation Work Permits (PGWP)</li>
          <li>International Experience Canada (IEC)</li>
          <li>Inland Spousal or Common-Law Sponsorship</li>
          <li>Bridging Open Work Permits (BOWP)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Open work permits do not require a Labour Market Impact Assessment
        (LMIA).

        Open work permits are highly sought after for the freedom they give
        their holders. While most work permits are tied to a specific employer,
        an open work permit allows a foreign national to work for any employer
        in Canada and the freedom to move from location to location at their own
        discretion. By gaining Canadian work experience, many foreign nationals
        will improve their eligibility for Canadian permanent residency.

        <br />
        Foreign nationals in the following situations may be eligible to apply
        for an open work permit:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spouses or common-law partners of some temporary foreign workers
          </li>
          <li>Spouses or common-law partners of some international students</li>
          <li>
            Some international students who have graduated from a designated
            program of study in Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            Permanent residency applicants who have applied through the inland
            spousal sponsorship process
          </li>
          <li>
            Some young workers participating in programs offered through
            International Experience Canada (IEC)
          </li>
          <li>
            Refugees, refugee claimants, protected persons and their family
            members
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The exact eligibility requirements and application procedure varies
        depending on which of the above-mentioned situations a foreign national
        meets.
