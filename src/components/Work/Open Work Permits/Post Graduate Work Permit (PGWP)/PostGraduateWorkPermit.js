        Post-graduation work permits (PGWPs) are open work permits given to
        international students who graduate from a Canadian program of study.
        PGWPs allow the holder to work for any employer, for as many hours as
        they wish, anywhere in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        PGWPs are valid for between eight months to three years and are a great
        way to obtain valuable Canadian work experience. Once an applicant has
        work experience in Canada, it opens a lot of opportunities to obtain
        Canadian permanent residence.

        <sp>What is a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Post-Graduation Work Permits (PGWPs) are for international students who
        have graduated from a Canadian Designated Learning Institution (DLI).
        PGWPs are open work permits, meaning that they grant foreign nationals
        the freedom to work for any employer, anywhere in Canada.

        <br />
        <br />
        Not all programs of study in Canada are eligible for a post-graduation
        work permit. Be sure to verify PGWP eligibility before selecting a
        program.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>
          Unlike most Canadian work permits, the PGWP does not require a Labour
          Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).{" "}
        </bold>
        PGWPs enable eligible graduates to gain valuable Canadian work
        experience.

        <sp>PGWP quick facts</sp>
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          1. A post-graduation work permit can be valid for any length of time
          between eight months and three years.
          <br />
          2. A PGWP will not be issued for a duration longer than the
          applicant’s duration of study in Canada. <br />
          3. Generally, the PGWP will be approximately the same duration as the
          applicant’s period of study, up to a maximum of three years.
          <br />
          4. As long as more than 50% of your program of study is conducted via
          in-person classes, you are eligible for a PGWP equal to the duration
          of your program of study.
          <br />
          5. If you studied part-time, or did accelerated studies, the length of
          your PGWP will be the length of your program of study, if taken
          full-time.
          <br />
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        <sp>Who is eligible for a PGWP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to be eligible for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP), a
        foreign national must be at least 18 years old and have studied
        full-time in Canada in a program of at least 8 months. The study program
        must have been completed at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) in
        one of the following types of programs listed below. As well, in order
        to apply for the work permit,
        <bold>
          {" "}
          a foreign national must apply within 180 days of the completion of
          their study program.{" "}
        </bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        If an applicant is applying from within Canada, they must have valid
        status at the time of application. If their study permit has expired or
        will expire, they may apply for status as a visitor before applying for
        the PGWP. However, applicants who apply for a PGWP prior to the
        expiration of their study permit are eligible to begin working full time
        immediately, while their application is processed. Applicants may apply
        for a PGWP from overseas.

        <bold>ELIGIBLE LEVELS OF STUDY</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        The following levels of study and programs are eligible for PGWPs:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            public post-secondary school, such as a college, trade/technical
            school or university, or CEGEP in Quebec; or
          </li>
          <li>
            private post-secondary school that operates under the same rules as
            public schools (only applies to certain institutions in Quebec); or
          </li>
          <li>
            private secondary or post-secondary school (in Quebec) that offers
            qualifying programs of 900 hours or longer, leading to a diplôme
            d’études professionnelles (DEP) or an attestation de spécialisation
            professionnelle (ASP); or
          </li>
          <li>
            Canadian private school that can legally award degrees under
            provincial law{" "}
            <bold>
              {" "}
              only for those enrolled in study programs leading to a degree{" "}
            </bold>
            as authorised by the province.
          </li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        <sp>How long does it take to get a PGWP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A PGWP can take anywhere from 80 to 180 days to process. While waiting
        for your PGWP, you are free to work in Canada provided you applied prior
        to the expiry date of your student permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        You have 180 days to apply for your PGWP from the date you completed all
        the requirements of your program of study.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you leave Canada after your studies have been completed, you can now
        apply for a PGWP from overseas. Previously post-graduation work permit
        applications needed to be submitted exclusively from within Canada. If a
        PGWP application is submitted from outside of Canada, additional
        documentation may be requested depending on the visa office that will
        process the application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I apply for a work permit after my PGWP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There is nothing about a PGWP that prevents you from applying for
        another work permit later. You are free to apply for both an LMIA or
        LMIA exempt permit if you are eligible but it might be worth considering
        applying for Canadian permanent residence given you already have
        Canadian work experience.

        <sp>Can I work after graduation before I apply for my PGWP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        International graduates who apply for a PGWP before the expiry of their
        study permit are able to begin legally working in Canada. These
        candidates do not need to hold a Canadian work permit while they await a
        decision on their application for a PGWP. If your student permit has
        expired, you may be eligible to restore your status and apply, provided
        you have only been out of status for less than 90 days.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How many times can I apply for a PGWP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can only apply for a PGWP once. If you are planning on taking
        another program of study that is a continuation of your first program,
        or you are considering taking a longer degree program in Canada, you
        might want to apply for your PGWP strategically. Applying after the
        longest period of study will grant you a PGWP with longer validity, to a
        maximum of three years.
        <br />
        <br />
        How a PGWP can help you immigrate to Canada
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada’s Post Graduation Work Program is designed to provide an
        efficient path for international students in Canada to gain permanent
        residence status in the country. By bridging Canadian education into
        meaningful full-time work experience in the country, a candidate is in a
        great position to apply under the Canadian Express Entry immigration
        system. Having a Canadian educational credential and work experience
        ensures that an Express Entry applicant will gain valuable extra points
        towards their comprehensive ranking system (CRS) score, making them more
        competitive amongst other applicants for gaining permanent resident
        status!
        <br />
        <br />
        Provincial nominee programs (PNPs), or if you studied in Quebec, the
        Quebec Experience Class program, are also immigration categories that
        favour candidates with a Canadian educational credential and work
        experience.
