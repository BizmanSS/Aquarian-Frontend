        International Experience Canada (IEC) is a set of programs enabling
        young people from participating countries to travel to Canada to live
        and work temporarily. Foreign nationals who are successful through one
        of the IEC programs will be authorised to apply for a Canadian work
        permit without the need for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
        IEC authorises temporary stay in Canada, with the approval of work
        permits for a maximum of one year.

        <br />
        <br />
        IEC work permits are approved through a randomised draw system. Not all
        foreign nationals who submit expressions of interest will be selected
        for the program. Chances of success depend on the quota for each program
        and country. The IEC operates three separate programs. While IEC has
        general requirements, interested applicants should verify the
        requirements for the separate programs. Each program has unique
        requirements and can result in a different form of work authorization:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Working Holiday</li>
          <li>Young Professionals</li>
          <li>International Co-op Internship</li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        It should be noted that while IEC encompasses these three programs,
        Canada has a unique relationship with each of the participating
        countries. For this reason, some participating countries may only offer
        one or two of the IEC programs, while others will offer all three
        options.
        <br />
        <br />
        Did you know?
        <br />
        <br />
        International Experience Canada is based on reciprocal bilateral
        agreements between Canada and other nations. This means that Canadian
        citizens are eligible for similar opportunities to travel and work in
        IEC participating countries!
        <br />
        <br />
        Eligibility for the IEC Program
        <br />
        <br />
        To participate in International Experience Canada a foreign national
        must be within the accepted age range for their country’s program
        (maximum age of 35 years old) and their country of citizenship must have
        an agreement with Canada allowing the foreign national to apply for a
        work permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        IEC encompasses three separate programs. Member countries may not
        participate in all three types of programs. As well, eligibility
        criteria, application procedure, and likelihood of success vary from
        program to program and from country to country. Full details about
        participating countries’ program requirements can be accessed on the
        Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website. If a
        country is not listed it may still be possible to participate in IEC.
        However, in this case, the foreign national must access the program
        through the assistance of a Recognized Organization.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Working Holiday Visa</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Working Holiday visa is ideal for individuals who want the freedom
        to work for any employers while travelling in Canada. Applicants who are
        successful through the Working Holiday program receive an open work
        permit. Open work permits are not tied to specific employers, so
        individuals have the freedom to change employers and locations while
        living in Canada. The Working Holiday program is a good option for
        foreign nationals from participating countries who are seeking the
        following:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Those without a job offer from a Canadian employer</li>
          <li>Those who want the freedom to work for more than one employer</li>
          <li>
            Those who would like the freedom to live in more than one location
          </li>
          <li>Those wishing to earn money while travelling</li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        As the Working Holiday program has relatively relaxed requirements, this
        program is incredibly popular. Canada approves predetermined quotas of
        applicants for this program on a per-country basis. Applicants
        interested in this program should verify the quotas for their country in
        order to gain an accurate understanding of their probability of success.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Young Professionals</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Young Professionals program allows foreign nationals to gain
        Canadian professional work experience by working with a Canadian
        employer. This program requires that applicants have a job offer from a
        Canadian employer in order to apply. Applicants who are successful
        through the Young Professionals program will be issued an{" "}
        <bold> employer-specific work permit.</bold> This means they must work
        for the same employer in the same location during their stay in Canada.
        The Young Professionals program is a good option for foreign nationals
        from participating countries who are seeking the following:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Those with a job offer from a Canadian employer which contributes to
            their professional development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Those who intend to work for the same employer in the same location
            while in Canada
          </li>
          <li>Those whose work will be: paid and not self-employed</li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        Generally, a position must be National Occupation Classification (NOC)
        Skill Level 0, A, or B to be considered as contributing to professional
        development. Participating countries have varying quotas to be filled
        annually for this program. Interested applicants should verify quotas
        for their country to understand the probability of their success.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>International Co-op</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The International Co-op Internship program allows international students
        to complete an internship or work placement in Canada as a requirement
        for their post-secondary education. This program requires that
        applicants have a job offer for a work placement or internship in Canada
        which is required for their completion of studies. Applicants who are
        successful through this program receive an employer-specific work
        permit, meaning that they must work for the same employer in the same
        location during their stay in Canada. The International Co-op Internship
        program is a good option for foreign nationals from participating
        countries who are seeking the following:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Those who are international students registered at a post-secondary
            institution
          </li>
          <li>
            Those with a job offer for a work placement or internship in Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            Those requiring a work placement or internship to complete their
            studies
          </li>
          <li>
            Those willing to work for the same employer in the same location
            during their stay in Canada
          </li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        Interested applicants should consult the requirements for their country
        to verify exact application procedures as well as quotas for the
        program.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>IEC Application Procedure</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals interested in applying to an IEC program must follow a
        five step process:
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Step One: Create an IEC profile </bold>Once a foreign national
        determines that their country participates in IEC and selects their
        preferred program, they may create an account on the IEC website. As
        long as they meet the eligibility requirements their account is
        automatically entered into the IEC pool of candidates.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Step Two: Receive an Invitation to Apply </bold>IEC regularly
        conducts random draws of IEC candidates. If a candidate is selected in a
        draw, they will be issued an Invitation to Apply, which enables them to
        move onto step three. Quotas vary by program and by country, so
        candidates should verify their country’s quotas to gain a better
        understanding of their probability of receiving an Invitation to Apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Step Three: Accept the Invitation to Apply </bold>If a candidate
        receives an Invitation to Apply, they are given 10 days to accept the
        invitation. After accepting, they are given 20 days to submit an online
        application for a work permit. If an applicant chooses to decline an
        invitation they will be returned to the pool of candidates and will
        continue being considered in future draws.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Step Four: Submit Work Permit Application </bold>After accepting
        an Invitation to Apply, a foreign national has 20 days to submit a work
        permit application online using the IRCC web portal. Applicants should
        review documentation requirements in advance so they can be sure they
        will have sufficient time to prepare the application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Step Five: Receive Work Permit </bold>If an application is
        successful, the applicant will receive confirmation of their work permit
        and issued information about the validity period of their authorization
        to work in Canada.
        <br />

        IEC Overview
        <br />
        <br />
        International Experience Canada conducts draws regularly. The quotas
        vary for each of the three IEC programs and program-based quotas vary
        from country to country. In order to determine the likelihood of success
        through one of the IEC programs, it is best to consult the International
        Experience Canada webpage to consult the exact program quotas per
        country. Generally, IEC updates their website with information about new
        draws each Friday.
