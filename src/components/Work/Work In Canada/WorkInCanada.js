        A work permit is a legal document permitting a foreign national to
        engage in employment while inside of Canada. Each year, Canada issues
        about half a million work permits to temporary foreign workers around
        the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada is a prime destination for many foreign nationals who are seeking
        employment opportunities. Working in Canada is also an excellent first
        step for those seeking to immigrate to the country permanently.

        <sp>Who is eligible to work in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Most foreign nationals require a permit to be eligible to work in
        Canada, with some exemptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        To apply for a work permit, most candidates will require a Canadian job
        offer supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). There are
        some exceptions to this requirement, where foreign workers can apply for
        a work permit without an LMIA, or a job offer. Examples of this include
        a recent graduate from a Canadian Designated Learning Institute (DLI),
        or the spouse of someone already on a Canadian work or study permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Candidates who qualify to apply for a work permit must also meet the
        following eligibility requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Demonstrate their intent to leave once their work authorization
            expires; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Prove they have sufficient funds to support them and their family in
            Canada and to return home; and
          </li>
          <li>Are not criminally or medically inadmissible to Canada; and</li>
          <li>Plan to work with an eligible employer; and</li>
          <li>
            Can provide any requested documents that may prove their eligibility
            to enter Canada
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Types of Canadian work permits</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are many different options for obtaining a Canadian work permit.
        Some work permits require a job offer from a Canadian employer, some
        require that the employer provide a Labour Market Impact Assessment
        (LMIA), while others require that a person has some sort of connection
        to Canada (previous education, spousal sponsorship, etc.). Please refer
        to the following categories below to determine the work permit which

        <bold>Immigration Tip:</bold> Canadian permanent residents do not
        require a work permit to work in Canada. Permanent resident status gives
        a person the legal right to live and work anywhere in the country. Find
        out more about permanent immigration options for professional and
        skilled workers.

        <sp>How to obtain a Canadian work permit</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The process for obtaining a work permit in Canada varies greatly
        depending on which type of permit a person is applying for. For example,
        an international student studying in Canada will oftentimes be
        automatically issued authorization to work part-time as part of their
        study permit authorization.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most closed work permit applications require that a foreign national has
        an official job offer from a Canadian employer which is supported by a
        Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Even those who are LMIA-exempt
        or exempt from requiring a work permit should be aware of the unique
        documentation they need to prepare in order to ensure they are granted
        entry to Canada. There are two general pathways for obtaining a Canadian
        work permit: a closed (restricted) work permit and an open work permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Closed work permits are tied to specific employers, this means that a
        foreign national issued a closed work permit must remain working with
        the same employer at the same location unless they change their work
        permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        If I have a Canadian job offer, am I eligible to apply for a work
        permit?
        <br />
        <br />
        Having a Canadian job offer does not necessarily mean you are eligible
        to apply for a work permit. A job offer must meet certain requirements
        to be considered valid for certain work permit applications. In most
        cases, in order to be eligible for a work permit, an applicant’s job
        offer must be either: <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          1. Supported by a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA); or
          <br />
          2.Exempt from requiring an LMIA.
        </ul>
        <br />
        It is important to note that the province of Quebec has its own process
        for determining the validity of an offer of employment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What am I allowed to do on a Canadian work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Your physical work permit outlines the specific restrictions attached to
        your authorization. These limitations will mainly be determined by the
        type of work permit you are eligible for. Conditions may include the
        type of work you can engage in, where and for whom you can work, and how
        long you can work in Canada. All work permit holders are prohibited from
        working at a business where is are grounds to suspect a risk of sexual
        exploitations of some workers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Work permit holders are not permanent residents of Canada and must leave
        the country by the end of their authorized stay. However, if you are
        working in Canada and would like to remain permanently, complete our
        free assessment form to receive a full evaluation of your immigration
        options.

        <sp>Can my family be included on my work permit application?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are applying for an employer-supported work permit, you may be
        eligible to have your spouse and dependent children accompany you to
        Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your children are school-aged and are in Canada, they may attend
        Canadian educational institutions without requiring a separate study
        permit. Your spouse or partner may also be eligible to apply for an open
        work permit, allowing them to work for any employer in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How much does a Canadian work permit cost?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The processing fee for a closed work permit is $155 CAD per person or
        $255 per person for an open work permit. If you are restoring a work
        permit or applying as a group of performing artists, additional fees
        will apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How do I apply for a work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The application procedure is different depending on which type of work
        permit you need. The first step is determining which work permit is best
        for you. If you need help figuring out the application, simply contact
        us and a member of our team will assist you with scheduling a
        consultation.

          What documents are required to apply for a Canadian work permit?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The documents required for a work permit in Canada will depend on the
        type of permit you are applying for. Applicants may need to provide the
        following documents as part of their work permit application:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Completed application forms</li>
          <li>Proof of status in Canada (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Family member’s proof of status (if applicable)</li>

          <li>Written offer of employment (if applicable)</li>
          <li>CV/ résumé</li>
          <li>Marriage certificate (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Certificat d’acceptation du Québec (CAQ) (if applicable)</li>

          <li>Valid copy of your passport</li>
          <li>Copy of education credential</li>

        <sp>Biometrics for Canadian work permits</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        IRCC currently has a temporary measure in place that exempts applicants
        applying for a work permit from within Canada. Candidates outside of
        Canada are still required to provide biometrics upon receiving a
        biometrics instruction letter.
        <br />
        <br />
        Follow the government of Canada’s instructions for how to give your
        biometrics on their dedicated page.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Police clearances for Canadian work permits</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The visa officer reviewing your application may ask you to provide
        police clearances certificates. Depending on where you are applying
        from, this document may be part of your application checklist and must
        be provided with your initial submission.
        <br />
        <br />
        Work permit applicants may be required to provide a police clearance
        certificate from any country that they have lived in for 6 months or
        more past the age of 18.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Medical exam for Canadian work permit</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals that apply to work in Canada may need to complete a
        medical exam, depending on their intended length of stay, where they
        have lived, and what occupation they will work in.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you intend to work in Canada for less than 6 months, you will likely
        not require a medical exam, with some exceptions. In the case that you
        intend to work in a job that brings you into close contact with people
        or are an agricultural worker that has been to certain countries, you
        will need a medical exam.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are planning to work in Canada for longer than 6 months, you will
        be required to take a medical exam if one of the following conditions
        applies:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          1. You have lived in or travelled to one of the countries listed on
          Canada’s ‘Find out if you need a medical exam’ page for 6-months or
          longer, or <br />
          2. You intend to work in an occupation where you will be in close
          contact with people listed in the above-mentioned hyperlink
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        Medical exams must be completed with a panel physician designated by
        IRCC. You can find a panel physician near you on IRCC’s Find a Panel
        Physician webpage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Applicants have the option to take an upfront medical exam. This
        involves contacting the panel physician directly and taking the exam
        prior to submitting a work permit application. If you do not provide
        your medical exam results with your application, the IRCC officer will
        send instructions on how to complete the medical exam and provide a
        deadline for when it needs to be completed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Photo requirements for Canadian work permit</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals applying for a work permit in Canada must provide a
        passport-sized photo with their application. The photo must be according
        to IRCC’s specifications.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How long will it take to process my work permit application?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The processing time for a work permit application depends on the type of
        permit and the applicant’s country of residence at the time of
        application. Processing times range anywhere from a few weeks to several
        months.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How long will it take to process my LMIA application?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are two types of Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)
        applications: a regular LMIA and a simplified LMIA. The simplified LMIA
        is only available in the province of Quebec. The regular LMIA is
        processed on a case-by-case basis with processing times varying greatly
        from applicant to applicant. Generally, it takes a minimum of five
        months to receive a response on a regular LMIA application. If an
        employer is eligible for Canada’s Global Talent Stream, they may qualify
        for expedited LMIA processing. The simplified LMIA completed for Quebec
        employment is usually processed in approximately two to three months.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is the rate of success for work permit/LMIA applications?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        It is impossible to give a rate of success for work permit/LMIA
        applications, as all applications are processed on a case-by-case basis.
        If an applicant meets the requirements of the LMIA, their application
        should be approved. However, applications are assessed by individual
        officers, each exercising their own discretion in choosing whether or
        not to approve a work permit application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How can I check the status of my work permit application?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you submitted an online work permit application, you may check the
        status through your online account. If you submitted a paper-based
        application, you may check the status by linking it to an online IRCC
        account.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Reasons a work permit application is refused.</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Receiving a work permit refusal can be devastating. There are many
        reasons a work permit can be refused. If it is unclear why your
        application was refused, applying for GCMS notes may help get a better
        idea, and can help address the officer’s concerns if you decide to
        reapply. Here are some common reasons for a work permit refusal:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The officer was not convinced that you could adequately perform your
            intended work;
          </li>
          <li>
            The officer was not convinced that you would return to your home
            country at the end of your authorised stay in Canada;
          </li>
          <li>
            You do not meet the criteria for the work permit you applied for
          </li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        <sp>
          How can I include my spouse and dependents on my work permit
          application?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are applying for a closed Canadian work permit, your spouse may
        be eligible for an open work permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your spouse is eligible, they will need to apply for their own work
        permit. In most cases, they must apply for this permit online.

        How you activate your work permit will depend on where you are applying

        Certain positions in Canada may require a person to know their National
        Occupation Classification Code (NOC Code). This code is used to classify
        all types of employment by Canadian standards.

        <sp>Benefits of working in Canada</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Working in Canada has many benefits. Canadian labour laws ensure that
        workplaces have a high-degree of safety and that all employers follow
        certain laws and regulations to ensure the well being of their
        employees. As well, Canadian wages are competitive and foreign nationals
        are required, by law, to be offered wages equivalent to their Canadian
        counterparts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, some Canadian work permits enable the spouse and children of
        workers to accompany them to Canada. Another significant benefit for
        those interested in immigrating to Canada permanently is that by gaining
        Canadian work experience, a foreign national may increase their
        eligibility for a number of Canadian permanent residency programs. The
        following programs award value, in varying degrees, for Canadian work
        experience:

        <sp>How can I extend my work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Generally, temporary foreign workers that are eligible to extend their
        work permit must apply online. If you plan to extend your work permit,
        it is recommended to do so at least 30 days before the expiry date of
        your current permit. While this is a recommendation, technically an
        applicant has until the last day of expiry to apply for the extension
        request.

        <sp>What is my work permit number?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find your work permit number on the top right hand corner of
        your permit and it begins with the letter “U”.
        <br />

        <sp>Can I work in Canada without a work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals must obtain a work permit to work in Canada with few
        exceptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I get a Canadian work permit without a job offer?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals interested in working in Canada usually require a
        written job offer from a Canadian employer to apply for a work permit.
        However, there are some circumstances that allow foreign workers to
        apply for an open work permit without a job offer, which allows them to
        work anywhere in Canada, for any employer.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp> Do Canadian work permits have an age limit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign workers must be at least 18 to obtain a Canadian work permit.
        There is no maximum age for work permit applicants unless applying under
        the International Experience Canada (IEC) program.

        <sp>
          Can I apply for Canadian health insurance while on a work permit?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Healthcare in Canada is administered by each province and territory,
        which operate their own insurance plan. Certain provinces allow work
        permit holders to apply for provincial health insurance coverage. Most
        provinces require residents to be physically present for a certain
        number of days before becoming eligible for health insurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is the difference between a Canadian work permit and visa?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A Canadian work permit authorises foreign nationals to work in Canada,
        whereas a visa is a travel document that is used to enter the country.
        <br />
        <br />
        A visa, or, temporary resident visa (TRV), is a physical sticker placed
        in your passport that acts as a travel document, allowing foreign
        nationals to enter Canada or transit through a Canadian airport.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you leave Canada, you cannot return without a valid visa or eTA, even
        if you have a valid work permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Do I need IELTS to apply for a Canadian work permit?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada does not require individuals applying for a work permit to write
        the IELTS or any other English or French language exam. However, if the
        job offer specifically requires French and/or English skills, and the
        applicant is from a non-French or English country, evidence of language
        abilities such as a language test could be required by the officer.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How long are Canadian work permits valid?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian work permits are typically valid for a period of 1-2 years,
        with some exceptions. A visa officer will usually not issue a work
        permit for longer than the validity of an applicant’s passport or past
        the validity indicated on the applicant’s Labour Market Impact
        Assessment (LMIA). A work permit will also not be issued for longer than
        the foreign national has applied to stay in Canada for, or beyond the
        duration that is required for the job offer. The length of a work permit
        may also be shorter depending on the program the applicant is applying
        under.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Do I need my Canadian work permit to enter Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you travel outside of Canada, you will need your work permit in
        addition to a valid travel document to re-enter. A work permit allows
        you to work in Canada, but alone does not permit you to travel to
        Canada. To come to Canada, you will need either a temporary resident
        visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), in addition to a valid
        passport.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can my employer sponsor me to work in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian employers don’t “sponsor” candidates to work in Canada but can
        assist in bringing foreign workers by securing a Labour Market Impact
        Assessment (LMIA) or submitting an electronic job offer (LMIA exempt
        categories).
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada requires that any Canadian employer who wishes to hire a foreign
        worker must obtain an LMIA or submit an electronic job offer. Once an
        employer secures an LMIA or the “A” number (electronic job offer), it
        can be used to apply for a Canadian work permit.
