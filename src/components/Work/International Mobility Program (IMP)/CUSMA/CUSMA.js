        This agreement provides unique opportunities for citizens of the United
        States and Mexico to work in Canada. Those foreign nationals covered by
        CUSMA provisions may be eligible to work in Canada without the
        requirement for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) or, in some
        cases, a work permit.

        The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trilateral trade
        agreement negotiated between Canada, the United States, and Mexico in
        1994. It was superseded by Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)
        as of July 1st, 2020.
        <br />
        <br />
        This new agreement maintains identical provisions for business visitors
        and workers travelling between the countries as are outlined in CUSMA.
        <br />
        <br />
        CUSMA establishes five situations wherein an American or Mexican citizen
        may be eligible for some sort of facilitated access to Canadian work
        authorization:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>CUSMA Professionals</li>
          <li>CUSMA Intra-Company Transferees</li>
          <li>CUSMA Investors</li>
          <li>CUSMA Traders</li>
          <li>CUSMA Business Visitors</li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        In order to be eligible for LMIA or work permit exemptions under CUSMA,
        a person must be a citizen of Canada, the United States, or Mexico.
        Permanent residents of these countries are not eligible for CUSMA’s
        temporary resident benefits.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>CUSMA Professionals</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The CUSMA Professionals provision provides the opportunity for
        professional workers to apply for a Canadian work permit without the
        need for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). In order to be
        eligible under this provision, the worker must have work experience in
        one of the CUSMA Professionals List of Occupations and have an offer of
        employment to practise the profession with an employer in Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        Work permits issued to CUSMA professionals may be issued for a maximum
        duration of three years. Professionals are eligible to apply for
        extensions of up to three years, with no limit on the number of
        extensions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>CUSMA Intra-Company Transfers</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under CUSMA, in some circumstances, a citizen of the United States or
        Mexico may transfer from within their enterprise to an enterprise
        located in Canada. In transferring to the Canadian enterprise, the
        employee will be exempt from needing a Labour Market Impact Assessment
        (LMIA), though they will be required to apply for a Canadian work
        permit. In order to qualify for this program, both the employee and the
        enterprise must meet certain requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Work permits for CUSMA intra-company transferees may be issued for a
        maximum duration of three years. Intra-company transferees may apply for
        extensions of up to two years.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>CUSMA Investors</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under CUSMA, some American and Mexican investors are eligible to apply
        for a Canadian work permit without the need for a Labour Market Impact
        Assessment (LMIA). In order to qualify for this LMIA-exemption, an
        investor must have committed, or is intending to commit, to investing a
        substantial amount of capital in Canada. As well, the investor’s
        enterprise must be American or Mexican in terms of nationality.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>CUSMA Traders</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under CUSMA, some American and Mexican traders are eligible to apply for
        a Canadian work permit without the need for a Labour Market Impact
        Assessment (LMIA). In order to qualify for this LMIA-exemption, a trader
        must demonstrate their involvement in the substantial trading of goods
        or services principally carried out between the United States or Mexico,
        and Canada. As well, the investor’s enterprise must be American or
        Mexican in terms of nationality.
        <br />
        <br />
        Work permits for NAFTA traders may be issued for a maximum duration of
        one year. Traders may apply for extensions of up to two years.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>CUSMA Business Visitors</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the agreement, some American and Mexican businesspeople are
        eligible to enter Canada to temporarily engage in international business
        activities without requiring a Canadian work permit nor a Labour Market
        Impact Assessment (LMIA). In order to be eligible as a business visitor,
        a person must be carrying out business activities which are
        international in scope. The business visitor must maintain that their
        primary source of remuneration and principal place of business is
        outside of Canada. The business visitor cannot have any intention to
        enter the Canadian labour market.
