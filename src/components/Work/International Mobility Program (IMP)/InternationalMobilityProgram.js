        The International Mobility Program (IMP) enables Canadian employers to
        hire temporary foreign workers without the need for a Labour Market
        Impact Assessment (LMIA). While an LMIA is usually required for a
        Canadian employer to hire a temporary foreign worker, there are a number
        of exemptions to the LMIA requirement.

        <br />
        <br />
        An LMIA-exemption refers to a situation in which it is not necessary for
        a Canadian employer to obtain an LMIA in order to hire a temporary
        foreign worker. ESDC along with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
        Canada (IRCC) maintain an index of LMIA-exemptions which are organised
        through the International Mobility Program.
        <br />
        <br />
        These LMIA exemptions are based on the following conditions:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            broader economic, cultural or other competitive advantages for
            Canada; and
          </li>
          <li>
            reciprocal benefits enjoyed by Canadians and permanent residents.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In order to hire a foreign worker through the IMP, a Canadian employer
        must follow three steps:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Confirm the position or worker in question qualifies for an
            LMIA-exemption;
          </li>
          <li>Pay the employer compliance fee of $230 CAD;</li>
          <li>
            Submit the official job offer through the IMP’s Employer Portal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Only after completing these three steps will the foreign national be
        eligible to apply for their own work permit. LMIA-exempt workers may
        qualify for expedited work permit processing through the Global Skills
        Strategy if their position is NOC Skill Level A or 0 and they are
        applying from outside of Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>International Agreements</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A significant number of LMIA-exemptions are available through
        international agreements between Canada and other countries. Certain
        types of employees can transfer to Canada from other countries, and vice
        versa, if they are able to demonstrate this will have a positive impact.
        Canada has negotiated the following Free Trade Agreements, each
        encompassing a range of LMIA-exemptions:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</li>
          <li>
            Canada-Chile FTA / Canada-Peru FTA / Canada-Colombia FTA /
            Canada-Korea FTA
          </li>
          <li>
            Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement
            (CETA)
          </li>
          <li>General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Canadian Interest Exemptions</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Another popular category of LMIA-exemptions falls under the broad
        category of Canadian Interest exemptions. LMIA-exemptions under this
        category must demonstrate that the exemption will be in the best
        interest of Canada, either by being of significant benefit to Canadians
        or through the maintenance of reciprocal employment relationships with
        other nations.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to qualify for an LMIA-exemption under the category of{" "}
        <bold>significant benefit</bold> for Canadians, the employment of a
        foreign national must demonstrate significant social or cultural benefit
        to Canada. Generally, immigration officers will assess a foreign
        national’s past track record of success and examine testimony and
        recommendations of distinguished experts in the foreign national’s field
        in order to determine significant benefit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Intra-Company Transferees</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Another means of securing LMIA-exemption for significant benefit is
        through the provision of LMIA-exemptions for intra-company transferees.
        Through this provision, certain companies may transfer a foreign
        national to a Canadian location in order to improve the quality of their
        business for the benefit of Canadians.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Additional LMIA-Exemptions</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        While the majority of LMIA-exemptions are granted due to either
        international agreements or Canadian interest, there are a number of
        LMIA-exemptions outside of these categories. In some cases,
        LMIA-exemptions are granted for humanitarian and compassionate reasons.
        As well, certain candidates for Canadian permanent residency may be
        eligible to apply for LMIA-exempt work permits.
