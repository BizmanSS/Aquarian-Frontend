        The Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement
        (CETA) is a multilateral trade agreement negotiated between Canada and
        the European Union (EU). The agreement came into effect on September
        21st, 2017. CETA provides unique opportunities for EU citizens to work
        in Canada. Those foreign nationals covered by CETA provisions may be
        eligible to work in Canada without the requirement for a Labour Market
        Impact Assessment (LMIA) or a even a work permit.

        CETA establishes four situations wherein an EU citizen may be eligible
        for facilitated access to Canadian work authorization:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>CETA Business Visitors</li>

        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Business Visitors</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Business visitors under CETA are eligible for short-term entry to Canada
        without a work permit or a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
        Business visitors are authorised for a maximum of 90 days in any
        six-month period. CETA business visitors may seek multiple entries to
        Canada for a series of regular visits pertaining to a specific project.
        Under CETA, there are two categories of business visitors:
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <sp>Intra-company transferees</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under CETA, intra-company transferees of enterprises located in EU
        nations may be eligible to obtain a Canadian work permit without
        requiring a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). In order to be
        eligible for the LMIA-exemption, intra-company transferees must meet the
        following general criteria:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Must have been employed by, or partners in, an enterprise located in
            an EU nation for at least one year
          </li>
          <li>
            Must be temporarily transferred to a Canadian enterprise with one of
            the following relationships to the EU enterprise: subsidiary,
            parent, branch, or head company.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In addition to the general criteria, intra-company transferees are
        divided into three categories, each encompassing its own specific
        requirements:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <bold>Senior Personnel</bold>
          </li>
          <li>
            <bold>Specialists</bold>
          </li>
          <li>
            <bold>Graduate Trainees</bold>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Investors</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under CETA, investors from EU member nations may be eligible to obtain a
        Canadian work permit without requiring a Labour Market Impact Assessment
        (LMIA). In order to meet the CETA eligibility requirements for
        investors, an applicant must meet the following criteria:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Involved with the establishment, development, administration, or
            operation of an investment in a capacity which is supervisory or
            executive;
          </li>
          <li>Must be the investor;</li>
          <li>
            Must be employed by an enterprise which has committed previously, or
            is currently committing, a substantial amount of capital in Canada.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Investors will be assessed using the criteria for investors described in
        the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Investors approved
        through CETA may be issued LMIA-exempt work permits for a maximum of one
        year, with possible extensions at the discretion of a visa officer.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Contractual Service Supplies and Independent Professionals</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under CETA, certain contractual service suppliers and independent
        professionals who are citizens of EU nations may be eligible to obtain a
        Canadian work permit without requiring a Labour Market Impact Assessment
        (LMIA). In order to be eligible for the LMIA-exemption, contractual
        service suppliers and independent professionals must meet the following
        general criteria (as well as specific criteria elaborated below):
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Citizens of a European Union member state</li>
          <li>
            Engaged in temporary supply of a service for a maximum of one year
          </li>
          <li>
            The service provided must be covered by a National Occupation
            Classification (NOC) Code included on the table of Canadaâ€™s CETA
            Commitments for Contractual Service Suppliers and Independent
            Professionals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In addition to the general criteria, contractual service suppliers and
        independent professionals must meet further specifications:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <bold>Contractual Service Suppliers</bold>
          </li>
          <li>
            <bold>Independent Professionals</bold>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>CETA Application Procedures</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Foreign nationals covered by CETA who are eligible to apply for an
        LMIA-exempt work permit or to enter Canada without a work permit
        (short-term business visitors), may apply at a Canadian Port of Entry
        (POE). Applications for work permits may also be submitted prior to
        travel to the appropriate Visa Application Centre (VAC). If an EU
        national is already inside of Canada as an authorised temporary
        resident, they may be able to submit a work permit application from
        inside the country.
        <br />
        <br />
        Work permits issued under CETA are eligible for extensions at the
        discretion of an immigration officer. Intra-company transferees are
        eligible for a maximum extension of up to 18 months. Graduate trainees
        are prohibited from any extensions.
