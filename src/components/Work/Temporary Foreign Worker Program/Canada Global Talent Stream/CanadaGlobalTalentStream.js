        <sp>What is the Global Talent Stream?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Global Talent Stream is one of the streams contained within Canada’s
        Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP). The GTS aims to facilitate the
        work permit process for certain Canadian employers, to hire highly
        skilled talent from around the world enabling them to compete on an
        international scale.
        <br />
        <br />
        Employers who are successfully approved through the program can expedite
        the process of hiring foreign nationals through the Global Skills
        Strategy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The GTS accepts applications through two categories. While there are
        some shared eligibility requirements, each category has unique
        requirements as outlined below.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How to apply for the Global Talent Stream</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Applying for a work permit through the Global Talent Stream is a
        two-step process.
        <br />
        <br />
        First, eligible GTS candidates must receive a positive Labour Market
        Impact Assessment (LMIA). It is the responsibility of the employer to
        apply for and pay for the LMIA process. This may be done by the employer
        or a third-party representative.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once a positive LMIA is received, the employee can apply for a Canadian
        work permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        The required documents will depend on your unique profile.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Global Talent Stream processing time</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the main benefits of the Global Talent Stream is its expedited
        work permit processing time; Global Talent Stream candidates may have
        their permits processed in under two weeks.
        <br />
        <br />
        Prior to applying for a work permit, Global Talent Stream employers must
        first receive a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). This
        process is also expedited with an average processing time of just 8
        days.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          How much does it cost to come to Canada through the Global Talent
          Stream?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The total cost of coming to Canada through the Global Talent stream is
        between $155 – $365 CAD, depending on where you intend to work.
        <br />
        <br />
        The processing fee for a Global Talent Stream work permit is $155 CAD.
        <br />
        <br />
        The LMIA application fee is $1000 CAD and is the responsibility of the
        GTS employers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Global Talent Stream work permit restrictions</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Global Talent Stream work permits are closed permits. This means that
        GTS candidates may only work for the employer indicated on their permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Is the Global Talent Stream LMIA-exempt?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        <italic>The GTS is not LMIA-exempt, </italic>but the LMIA process is
        significantly simplified. GTS employers are not required to provide
        proof of their efforts to recruit a Canadian citizen or permanent
        resident. This exemption considerably reduces the burden when submitting
        an LMIA application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I get permanent residence through the Global Talent Stream?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Global Talent Stream is a <italic> temporary </italic>residence
        program for a Canadian work permit, and not a
        <italic> permanent </italic>immigration program.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, working in Canada can significantly increase one’s chances of
        becoming eligible for a permanent residence program. To learn more about
