        The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) allows Canadian employers
        the ability to temporarily hire foreign nationals in order to fill
        shortages in Canada’s labour force. The TFWP is jointly operated by
        Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Employment and
        Social Development Canada (ESDC).

        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        The TFWP helps Canadian employers hire the foreign talent they need. It
        also makes sure that these foreign workers get the rights and
        protections they deserve to be safely employed in Canada. Under the
        TFWP, employers may hire temporary foreign workers through the following
        streams:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>High-Wage Workers</li>
          <li>Low-Wage Workers</li>
          <li>Global Talent Stream</li>
          <li>Foreign Agricultural Workers</li>
          <li>In-Home Caregivers</li>
          <li>Foreign Academics</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        One key characteristic of the TFWP is the requirement for a Labour
        Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Any employer wishing to hire a foreign
        national through TFWP must first obtain an LMIA demonstrating that they
        were unable to find a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to fill the
        position. Only after obtaining an LMIA will an employer be able to
        officially hire a foreign national, enabling the foreign national, in
        turn, to apply for a Canadian work permit or Canadian permanent
        residence.
        <br />
        <br />
        There do exist a number of temporary worker options which allow
        employers to hire workers without requiring an LMIA. These options are
        organised within the International Mobility Program which is designed to
        process LMIA-exempt work permit applications.

        <br />
        <sp>Labour Market Impact Assessments</sp>
        <br />
        <br />A Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is a document issued by
        ESDC assessing the impact hiring a foreign worker will have on the
        Canadian labour market. A<bold> positive LMIA </bold>indicates that
        there is no Canadian citizen or permanent resident to fill a position,
        therefore enabling an employer to hire a foreign national.
        <br />
        <br />A<bold> negative LMIA </bold>indicates that a position should be
        filled by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. Learn more about
        Labour Market Impact Assessments, including requirements and application
        procedures.

        <br />
        <sp>International Mobility Program</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The International Mobility Program (IMP) enables Canadian employers to
        hire temporary foreign workers without the need for a Labour Market
        Impact Assessment (LMIA). While most employers hiring foreign workers
        will require an LMIA, there are certain circumstances where
        LMIA-exemptions exist. These LMIA exemptions are based on the following
        conditions:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            broader economic, cultural or other competitive advantages for
            Canada; and
          </li>
          <li>
            reciprocal benefits enjoyed by Canadians and permanent residents.
          </li>
        </ul>{" "}
        <br />
        In order to hire a foreign worker through the IMP, a Canadian employer
        must follow three steps:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Confirm the position or worker in question qualifies for an
            LMIA-exemption;
          </li>
          <li>Pay the employer compliance fee of $230 CAD;</li>
          <li>
            Submit the official job offer through the IMP’s Employer Portal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Only after completing these three steps will the foreign national be
        eligible to apply for their own work permit. LMIA-exempt workers may
        qualify for expedited work permit processing through the Global Skills
        Strategy if their position is NOC Skill Level A or 0 and they are
        applying from outside of Canada.

        <sp>Global Talent Stream</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The Global Talent Stream (GTS) is a two-year pilot program launched in
        June 2017 through a partnership between Immigration, Refugees and
        Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Employment and Social Development Canada
        (ESDC). The GTS assists certain Canadian employers to hire highly
        skilled global talent enabling them to compete on an international
        scale. Employers who are successfully referred to the program will be
        able to expedite the process for hiring foreign nationals through the
        Global Skills Strategy.
