        The Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot was launched in 2019 as an
        initiative to stimulate economic growth in those areas by attracting
        skilled workers. This program includes communities in Ontario, Manitoba,
        Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Nunavut, the Northwest
        Territories, and Yukon.

        Canada is a country well-known for accepting high numbers of immigrants.
        However, under the current immigration system, the vast majority of new
        immigrants choose to live in major cities like Toronto, Montreal, and
        Vancouver. The Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot seeks to change this
        by helping smaller communities to attract newcomers and support their
        settlement. The pilot program accepts applications from rural and
        northern communities who want to participate. The communities accepted
        receive support from the Federal Government to help them identify and
        select new candidates for permanent residency. The newcomers are
        expected to have a positive impact on economic development.
        <br />
        <br />
        This program builds on the successes of the Atlantic Immigration Pilot
        program (AIP) which was launched in 2017. AIP is designed to increase
        immigration to Canadaâ€™s Atlantic Region by pairing up potential
        newcomers with employers from the region.

        As of June 2019, eleven communities have been selected to participate in

        area, or have a population of 200,000 or less and be considered removed
        from other larger cities. Communities must be located in one of the
        following provinces or territories:

        <ul>
          <li>Alberta</li>

        Communities also must demonstrate they have employment opportunities
        available for newcomers, as well as having the ability to support the
        settlement of newcomers.
