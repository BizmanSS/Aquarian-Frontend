        Once a person
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is a Permanent Resident?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A Canadian permanent resident is a citizen of another country who has
        been granted permission to live in Canada as a permanent resident. Once
        a person has permanent resident status, they have the right to live and
        work anywhere in the country. Permanent residents receive a significant
        number of benefits in Canada, including access to healthcare and social
        services, the right to live, work, and study anywhere in Canada, and
        protection under Canadian law. As well, after being a permanent resident
        for a certain amount of time, permanent residents are eligible to apply
        to become Canadian citizens! Notably, Canadian permanent residents do
        not have the right to vote in Canadian elections.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is a Citizen?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian citizens have many rights and privileges in Canada. Citizens
        have access to healthcare, social services, and support under the law. A
        citizen can live, work, and study, anywhere in Canada, and has the right
        to vote in Canadian elections. As well, citizenship cannot be revoked or
        removed. All people born in Canada automatically qualify for Canadian
        citizenship. As well, foreign nationals can become naturalised Canadian
        citizens by going through the proper application process with
        Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I Work Anywhere in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once a person has Canadian permanent resident status, they have the
        authorization to live and work anywhere in Canada. If a foreign national
        does not have Canadian permanent resident status, then they must have
        the proper authorization to work in Canada. Usually, this authorization
        comes in the form of a Canadian work permit.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I Bring My Family to Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Certain immigration programs allow foreign nationals to immigrate to
        Canada with their family members. However, the family members able to
        accompany a foreign national varies depending on the immigration
        program. For example, those immigrating through Canadaâ€™s Express Entry
        system are eligible to include their spouse and dependent children on
        the application, but not their parents. However, Canada has family
        sponsorship programs enabling Canadian citizens and permanent residents
        to sponsor their spouse or common-law partner, dependent children, and
        parents/grandparents. In order to determine whether or not your family
        members may join you, first you must determine which immigration pathway
        you choose to pursue!

        <br />
        <sp>Why is Canada Looking for Immigrants?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian cities and rural areas depend on newcomers to keep their
        populations growing and to support their labour markets. Canada also has
        an ageing population, and without a robust system of immigration, Canada
        would be on a similar trajectory to that of Japan in the 1990s. But
        unlike Japan, Canada embraced immigration and that has allowed us to
        maintain a large proportion of the population in prime working age,
        between 25 and 54. This would not be possible without mass immigration
        to Canada.
