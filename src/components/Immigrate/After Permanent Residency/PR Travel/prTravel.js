            All individuals need a valid travel document to enter Canada. For people with permanent resident status, the PR card serves this purpose. But if you are a permanent Canadian resident outside of Canada without a PR card, you need to apply for a Permanent Resident Travel Document to facilitate your return. The PRTD helps make the travel process smoother for individuals without a valid PR card.

                Provide proof of your residency days.

            You can apply for Permanent Resident Travel Document by following the given steps:
            <ol style={{ listStyle: "decimal", listStylePosition: "inside" }} className='my-3'>
                <li>
                Collect documents like proof of your permanent residency, travel documents, and evidence supporting your residency days. 
                
                </li>

                <li>
                Fill out accurate details in the PRTD application form (IMM 5524). 
                 
                </li>

                <li>
                Send the application form and supporting documents to the visa office. 
                </li>

                <li>
                Pay the processing fee with your application. 
        
                </li>

                <li>
                Processing times for PRTD applications can vary. Check the IRCC website for the latest updates on processing times.
                </li>
              </ol>
              If your PRTD application is approved, you can use it to return back to Canada. Once you are back, you can then apply for a new PR card if needed. There can be long processing times for PRTD applications, so you need to apply in advance of your planned travel to avoid any complications.
