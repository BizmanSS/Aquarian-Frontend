            Immigrants are attracted to Canadian citizenship because of its quality of living and healthcare facilities. According to statistics from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, more than 374,000 people have gained Canadian citizenship in just last year.
              <div className="pages-paragraph">
              With 85% of permanent residents becoming citizens, the citizenship rate in Canada remains high. Citizenship is obtained through naturalization, with the majority of citizens coming from India, the Philippines, China, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2023, India remained the top country of origin for new Canadian citizens. This contributed to 20% of all naturalizations.

              23% of Canadaâ€™s total population is made up of immigrants, and over 60% of immigrants eventually become citizens. Canadian citizenship comes with many benefits such as voting rights, access to health and social services, and the unrestricted ability to live, work, and travel throughout and outside the country.

              <li>

            Steps to Apply for Canadian Citizenship
            </div>
            <div className="pages-paragraph">
            The application process for Canadian citizenship is pretty straightforward:

            <ol style={{ listStyle: "decimal", listStylePosition: "inside" }} className='my-2 ml-3'>
              <li>
              Collect documents like proof of <a href='#' style={{color:'blue'}}><strong>permanent residency</strong></a>, tax records, language test results, and ID.
               
              </li>

              <li>
              Fill out the Canadian citizenship application form available on the official Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website. For children under the age of 18, you need to fill the application separately.

                
              </li>

              <li>
              The processing fee for adult applications is CAD 630 (including the right of citizenship fee). For children, the fee is CAD 100.
                
              </li>

              <li>
              Mail your completed application form and supporting documents to the IRCC office. 
              </li>

              <li>
              If you're between 18 and 54, youâ€™ll be required to take a citizenship test. This is a written test, but sometimes it may be administered orally.
              </li>
              <li>
              Some candidates are required to appear for an interview to check residency requirements.
              </li>

            </ol>

            If your application is accepted you will be invited to a citizenship ceremony, where you'll take an Oath of Citizenship. From that time on, officially you're a Canadian citizen and your certificate of citizenship will be issued. By understanding the different pathways to citizenship and preparing for the application process, you can increase your chances of becoming a proud Canadian citizen.
