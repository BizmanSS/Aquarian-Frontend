            New Brunswick has immigration pathways to address its regional labor shortages and attract skilled foreign workers. Among the most prominent employer-driven immigration streams are the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) and the New Brunswick Critical Worker Pilot (NBCWP). Successful candidates are eligible to settle and work in New Brunswick, contributing to the provinceâ€™s economic growth and cultural diversity. The streams are designed to support employers in hiring foreign talent to fill labor shortages. Employers play a key role in the recruitment, application, and settlement process for foreign workers.

            The New Brunswick Critical Worker Pilot is a five-year pilot program launched in 2022. It is aimed at addressing critical labor shortages in manufacturing, fisheries, forestry, and farming sectors. NBCWP is an entirely employer-driven program with selected companies sponsoring eligible foreign workers and providing settlement support.

            <ul className="my-2 ">
                <li>
                The pilot involves six key New Brunswick employers committed to supporting candidates' integration.
                </li>

                <li>
                Employers provide assistance with housing, language training, and other integration needs.
                </li>

                Candidates must be recruited by one of the six approved employers.
                </li>

                <li>
                Employers ensure language training (up to 200 hours) and help with obtaining Canadian education equivalency.
                </li>

                <li>
                Applicants must have a minimum high school diploma and relevant work experience.
                </li>

                <li>
                The program is aimed at workers intending to live long-term in New Brunswick, and employers provide extensive settlement support to facilitate this.
                </li>

              </ul>

              Interested applicants cannot apply directly; they must be recruited by one of the participating employers. After securing employment through the pilot, workers may receive support in applying for work permits and eventually permanent residency.
