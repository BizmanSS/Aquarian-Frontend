        Canada’s provincial nominee programs (PNPs) offer a pathway to Canadian
        permanent residence for individuals who are interested in immigrating to
        a specific Canadian province or territory. <br />
        <br />
        Each Canadian province and territory operates its own PNP designed to
        meet its specific economic and demographic needs.

        <bold>How to apply for a Provincial Nominee Program in Canada</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Step-by-Step guide to applying to a Canadian PNP:</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. <bold>Find the PNP that is right for you: </bold> Consult the list
          of provinces and territories at the top of this page to determine
          where you would like to immigrate. Make sure to check the requirements
          for each PNP to determine your eligibility. <br />
          <br />
          2. <bold>Apply to your chosen PNP: </bold> Submit an application
          directly to your chosen province or territory. <br />
          <br />
          3. <bold>Obtain a Provincial Nomination certificate: </bold> If your
          application is successful, the province or territory will nominate you
          to apply for Canadian permanent residence.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. <bold>Submit your application for permanent residence: </bold>{" "}
          Apply to the Canadian federal government for permanent residence. If
          your chosen PNP is aligned with Express Entry, you can do this online.
          If not, you must submit a paper-based application.
        </ul>
        <br />
        <bold>How to apply to through the 'base' PNP process</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Some PNPs do not require an Express Entry profile to apply. These
        programs are called ‘base’ PNPs. While the nomination process is
        different for each program, the general process is essentially:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          1. Apply for nomination <br />
          <br />
          2. If nominated, apply for Canadian permanent residence through
          Permanent Residence Portal.
        </ul>
        <br />
        Once you have been nominated by a Canadian province or territory, you
        can submit your application for Canadian permanent residence to
        Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada through IRCC’s online
        Permanent Residence Portal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Base PNP permanent residence applications take much longer to process
        than electronic applications submitted through Express Entry. While the
        average processing time for a permanent resident application submitted
        through Express Entry is 6 months, a paper-based application is
        processed in an average of 18 months.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>How does the PNP application process work?</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        The PNP application process will vary depending on the program an
        applicant is applying through. There are three main types of PNP
        processes:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Expression of Interest (EOI) process
        <br />
        <br />
        Some provinces require eligible candidates to first submit an Expression
        of Interest (EOI) profile to the program’s pool of candidates. The
        province then holds Expression of Interest draws, where they invite
        candidates to apply for nomination. The criteria of these draws usually
        change from draw to draw. The draws may target a combination of a
        candidate’s score on the province’s points grid, work experience in a
        particular occupation, language ability, or highest education level.
        <br />
        <br />
        Examples of programs that operate using an EOI system include Prince
        Edward Island Express Entry stream, Saskatchewan Occupation In-Demand
        and Express Entry streams, and Manitoba’s Skilled Worker streams.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Notification of Interest (NOI) process
        <br />
        <br />
        Other nominee programs invite candidates directly from the Express Entry
        pool without them even having applied. These programs typically target
        candidates with certain work experience or skills that respond to labour
        market needs. Examples of programs that send Notifications of Interest
        to candidates in the Express Entry pool include Ontario’s Human Capital
        Priorities stream, Ontario’s French-Speaker stream, Nova Scotia’s Labour
        Market Priorities stream, Alberta Express Entry stream
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Apply directly to the program
        <br />
        <br />
        Certain programs allow eligible candidates to apply directly for
        nomination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Examples of programs like this include BC PNP International
        Post-Graduate stream, the Alberta Opportunity Stream, and New
        Brunswick’s Skilled Worker stream.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Documents required for a PNP</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Candidates must provide documentation that demonstrates their
        eligibility for the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) they are applying
        to. Most provinces typically require:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>language results;</li>
          <li>educational credential assessment (ECA) reports;</li>
          <li>proof of work experience;</li>
          <li>proof of settlement funds;</li>
          <li>civil documents; and</li>
          <li>status documents</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Many PNPs also require proof that the applicant intends to reside in
        their province upon being nominated. Other required documents will
        depend on the program you are applying under.
