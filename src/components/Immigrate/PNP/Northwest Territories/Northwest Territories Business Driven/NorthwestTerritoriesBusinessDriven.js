        Business-savvy individuals with significant investment capital who are
        willing to permanently settle and establish a business in the Northwest
        Territories may apply under the business driven streams of the Northwest
        Territories Nomination Program (NTNP).
        <br />
        <br />
        Applicants will be required to present a viable business plan with the
        potential to create lucrative employment opportunities for other
        Canadian citizens and permanent residents. Top priority will be given to
        entrepreneurs who can establish a business that will provide significant
        benefits to this northern territoryâ€™s economy. The Northwest Territories
        Business Driven stream includes the following streams:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Northwest Territories Entrepreneur</li>
          <li>Northwest Territories Self-Employed (terminated)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <bold>Northwest Territories Entrepreneur</bold>
        Entrepreneurs who wish to establish, purchase, or invest in a Northwest
        Territories business in any economic sector may be eligible for
        provincial nomination through the NTNP Entrepreneur stream. Applicants
        will be required to submit a business plan for the proposed business,
        and priority will be given to businesses that introduce a new product or
        those that provide significant benefits to the Northwest Territories.
