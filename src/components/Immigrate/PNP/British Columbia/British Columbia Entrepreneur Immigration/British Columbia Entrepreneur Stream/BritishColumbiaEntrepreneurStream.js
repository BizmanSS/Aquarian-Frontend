        nationals with demonstrated experience owning and operating businesses
        who wish to invest their finances and expertise in business
        opportunities in the province of British Columbia.

        Candidates for BC Entrepreneur immigration are required to purchase a
        new or existing business in BC and become involved in the active
        day-to-day management of the BC operation. The entrepreneurial streams
        offer opportunities for wealthy individuals with business management
        experience, as well as wealthy foreign-owned companies who wish to
        expand the reach of their enterprise into British Columbia. Successful
        applicants will eventually receive a provincial nomination by the
        province of BC which will support applications for Canadian permanent
        residence. The three streams contained within British Columbia
        Entrepreneur Immigration are:

        The British Columbia Entrepreneur stream targets experienced business
        owners and managers who wish to live in British Columbia permanently.
        Applicants must demonstrate management experience as well as significant
        personal net worth. Successful applicants will be required to invest in
        the purchase and management of a new or existing BC business. After
        proving the successful operation of a BC business, the applicant becomes
        eligible for Canadian permanent residence.

        <br />
        The BC Entrepreneur Regional Pilot Stream of the BC PNP is for
        experienced entrepreneurs who want to invest in and manage a business in
        British Columbia. Applicants must be referred by one of the programâ€™s
        participating communities in BC.
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        British Columbia Strategic Projects targets successful foreign-owned
        companies who wish to establish a new branch or operation in BC.
        Companies must prove their ability to generate significant annual
        revenue alongside the management of large staff teams. Successful
        companies will be required to transfer key staff to BC to manage their
        new proposed operation. After proving the successful operation of their
        BC enterprise, these key staff members become eligible for Canadian
        permanent residence.
