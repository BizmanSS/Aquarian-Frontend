            The Prince Edward Island (PEI) Express Entry program is part of the province's immigration strategy. It is designed to attract skilled workers to address labour shortages and contribute to economic growth. It operates under the Provincial Nominee Program, allowing the province to nominate candidates for permanent residency based on their skills and work experience. Unlike many other Express Entry-aligned PNP streams, the Express Entry stream of the province does not require candidates to have a job offer from a PEI employer at the time of submitting their Expression of Interest.

              The PEI Office of Immigration prioritizes applications from individuals currently working in the province, particularly in high-demand sectors such as healthcare, trades, and early childhood education. After receiving an ITA, applicants must submit an official application for Canadian permanent residence within a designated timeframe. Applications through Express Entry are typically processed within six months.
