              The Alberta Graduate Entrepreneur Stream is an immigration stream
              of the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program or AINP. The stream
              helps international students who graduated from post-secondary
              institutions in Alberta to establish and run a business there. By
              fostering entrepreneurship, it also provides individuals with a PR
              in Canada. This immigration program uses a points-based Expression
              of Interest system to select and rank candidates for the stream.
              Candidates with the highest points are invited for submission of a
              business application.
