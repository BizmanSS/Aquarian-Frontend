        Ontario Express Entry Streams are a collection of immigration streams of
        the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP). Operated by the province
        of Ontario, this Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), encompasses three
        immigration streams targeting foreign nationals who demonstrate a
        collection of skills, experiences, and/or abilities which make them
        ideal candidates for Ontario’s labour force.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ontario Express Entry Stream includes the following streams:
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Ontario Human Capital Priorities - Express Entry </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Ontario Human Capital Priorities is one of the streams of Ontario Human
        Capital. This stream is aligned with the federal Express Entry system,
        so candidates must have an active Express Entry profile to be
        considered. Ontario selects exceptional candidates from the Express
        Entry pool and invites them to submit applications to the PNP.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Ontario French-Speaking Skilled Worker - Express Entry </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Ontario French-Speaking Skilled Worker is one of the streams of Ontario
        Human Capital. This stream is aligned with the federal Express Entry
        system, so candidates must have an active Express Entry profile to be
        considered. Ontario selects candidates from the Express Entry pool who
        have valid language tests demonstrating intermediate proficiency in both
        English and French. Those selected will be invited to submit an
        application to the PNP.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Ontario Skilled Trades - Express Entry</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Ontario Skilled Trades is one of the streams of Ontario Human Capital.
        This stream is aligned with the federal Express Entry system, so
        candidates must have an active Express Entry profile to be considered.
        Ontario selects candidates from the Express Entry pool who demonstrate
        recent work experience obtained within Ontario in one of Canada’s
        skilled trade occupations. Those selected by the province will be
        invited to submit an application to the PNP.
        <br />
        <br />
        Applicants who are successful through any of the Ontario Human Capital
        streams will receive an official provincial nomination from Ontario.
        This provincial nomination makes applicants eligible to apply for
        Canadian permanent resident status.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Before you apply: Create a profile in the Express Entry system</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To embark on your immigration journey to Ontario through the Express
        Entry system, you’ll first need to create a profile in the IRCC’s
        Express Entry System. This profile is a crucial step to receive a
        notification of interest, which is essential for applying to Ontario’s
        Express Entry streams. Your process commences with the completion of a
        questionnaire designed by IRCC to determine the immigration programs
        that best suit your circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        Within your Express Entry profile, you will need to indicate your
        interest in immigration to Ontario by selecting either Ontario or All
        Provinces and Territories. It’s imperative to provide accurate and
        truthful information in your profile. Inaccuracies could lead to the
        rejection of your OINP application, withdrawal of your nomination, or
        even a finding of inadmissibility, along with a potential five-year ban
        on applying for immigration to Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, to be eligible for Ontario’s Express Entry streams, you
        must meet the requirements of one of the federal programs, either the
        Federal Skilled Worker Program or the Canadian Experience Class. And
        when you submit your application to the OINP, you must specify the
        federal program under which you wish to be assessed. Please note that if
        you are applying under the Skilled Trades stream, you must meet the
        criteria of the Canadian Experience Class.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>Important Note: </bold>An Express Entry profile does not guarantee
        that you will be invited to apply to the OINP
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Notifications of interest </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        We search IRCC’s Express Entry pool to find candidates who may meet the
        criteria of one of Ontario’s Express Entry streams. If we identify you
        as a candidate, we will send you a notification of interest through your
        IRCC online account inviting you to submit an online application to the
        OINP.If you are invited to apply, you will receive a Notification of
        Interest in your IRCC online account. Important Note: A notification of
        interest does not guarantee you will receive a certificate of
        nomination.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>How to apply?</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you receive a Notification of Interest, that means the province is
        inviting you to submit an online application to the OINP. Then you must:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Demonstrate that you meet all stream requirements at the time of
            your application, including that you had the qualifications that you
            claimed in your Express Entry profile.If it is determined that any
            information provided in your Express Entry profile is not accurate,
            is incorrect, or misleading, your application may be denied, and you
            may be subject to penalties or prosecution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submit your application within<bold> 45 calendar days </bold>from
            the date you receive the notification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Maintain an Updated Express Entry profile</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To be eligible for nomination through Ontario’s Express Entry system,
        you must maintain a valid profile throughout the application process. If
        your profile expires while your application is being processed, you are
        required to promptly notify the province. This notification should
        include specific documentation, such as a copy of the letter from
        Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) acknowledging your
        new Express Entry profile and a copy of the letter from IRCC explaining
        the ineligibility of your old profile. Failing to inform the program
        about your new profile will lead to the return of your application as
        incomplete and a refund of your application fee.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, if you receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent
        residence from IRCC while your application is under review by the OINP,
        your profile will no longer be available for nomination by Ontario. In
        such a situation, you must make a choice between rejecting the ITA from
        IRCC or withdrawing your application with the OINP. If you opt to reject
        the ITA, you should also contact the province government.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What Happens If I Am Nominated?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are selected, you’ll receive a nomination approval letter and a
        nomination certificate via email. These details will be recorded in the
        IRCC Express Entry System, and you’ll also be notified of your
        nomination through your IRCC online account. You’ll have 30 days to
        either accept or decline the nomination in the Express Entry System. If
        accepted, you’ll gain an additional 600 points, increasing your chances
        of receiving an invitation to apply for permanent residence from IRCC in
        the subsequent invitation round.
        <br />
        <br />
        After accepting, you’ll have 60 days to submit your application for
        permanent residence to IRCC, which should include your nomination
        approval letter and nomination certificate. It’s crucial to note that a
        nomination does not guarantee the approval of your application for
        permanent residence with IRCC. Should your original Express Entry
        profile become ineligible, you may request a transfer of your nomination
        to a new Express Entry profile.
