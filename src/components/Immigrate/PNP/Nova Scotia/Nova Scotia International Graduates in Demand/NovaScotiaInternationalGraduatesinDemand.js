            The NS International Graduates in Demand (IGiD) stream is a part of the Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP). The program attracts recent international graduates who have completed their studies in Nova Scotia and have a permanent job offer in specific high-demand occupations. This initiative aims to address labor shortages in the province while providing a pathway for international students to gain permanent residency in Canada. The stream is not a part of the Express Entry program, therefore, processing time of NS International Graduate in Demand is usually longer.

            The application process for the IGiD stream involves following steps:

 

              <ul className="my-3">
                <li>
                Candidates must submit their application online through the NSNP portal when the stream is open.

                  
                </li>
                <li>
                If approved, candidates receive a nomination certificate from Nova Scotia.


                </li>
                <li>
                After receiving the nomination, candidates must apply for permanent residency through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) within 6 months.


                </li>
                <li>Candidates may request a letter of support from NSNP to apply for or renew a temporary work permit while waiting for their PR application to be processed.
</li>
             


              </ul>
              There is no application fee for NSNP streams. Processing times for applications under the Nova Scotia Nominee Program range from 3 to 6 months. The IGiD stream plays an important role in addressing labor shortages in Nova Scotia's economy by attracting skilled workers who are already familiar with the local culture and job market.
