        Targeted professions will change based on the provinceâ€™s labour needs.

        <br />
        <sp>Eligibility Criteria</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Candidates must be between the ages of 21 and 55 to apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        <Table />
        <br />
        <bold>Application Procedure</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Applications for the Nova Scotia Occupations In Demand category are
        accepted at all times, provided that an applicant meets program
        requirements. Applicants may apply using the online portal on the Nova
        Scotia immigration website. Successful applicants will be issued a
        provincial nomination for permanent residence from Nova Scotia.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once an applicant has been nominated, they will be issued a Letter of
        Support, allowing them to apply for a temporary work permit so they can
        travel to Nova Scotia to begin work.
        <br />
        <br />
        After receiving a provincial nomination an applicant has six months to
        submit a federal application for Canadian permanent residence.
        Applicants in this program must complete and submit a paper-based
        application for permanent residence and submit it by mail to the
        appropriate application centre. Paper-based PNP applications for
        permanent residence are generally processed within 18 months.
