        (NLNP) is open to skilled workers of NOC Skill Level 0, A, or B
        occupations who are in the federal Express Entry pool and who wish to
        settle in Newfoundland and Labrador, provided they meet certain
        eligibility requirements, and hold a guaranteed, full-time job offer.

        <bold>Application Procedure </bold>
        The Newfoundland and Labrador Express Entry Skilled Worker stream
        accepts applications at any time. Skilled workers hoping to immigrate to
        Newfoundland and Labrador must first submit a profile to the federal
        Express Entry pool. Once a candidate has been accepted into the Federal
        Express Entry pool and has a job offer from a Newfoundland and Labrador
        employer, they may submit their application. Successful applicants will
        receive a nomination from Newfoundland and Labrador.
        <br />
        <br />
        After accepting the provincial nomination, the applicantâ€™s Comprehensive
        Ranking System (CRS) score will increase by 600 points, virtually
        guaranteeing they will receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for
        permanent residence in the next Express Entry draw. After receiving an
        ITA, the applicant must prepare and submit an official application for
        Canadian permanent residence within the designated timeframe.
        Applications for permanent residence submitted through Express Entry are
        generally processed within six months.
