        <bold>Application Procedure</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        This program uses an Expression of Interest (EOI) system to select
        applicants. In order to be considered for the program, first a candidate
        must submit an EOI using the PNPâ€™s online service. The most competitive,
        qualified candidates will be invited to apply to the program.
        <br />
        <br />
        After receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) candidates must submit an
        official application for nomination to the province. This application
        includes documentation supporting the information included in the
        original EOI. As well, all applicants must pay an application fee of CAD
        $250 and must provide an Audit Report and a Business Continuity Plan,
        outlining their entrepreneurial intentions. If an application is deemed
        to be complete, the applicant will have to participate in an in-person
        interview.
        <br />
        <br />
        If an application is approved, the applicant will receive an official
        provincial nomination from Newfoundland and Labrador. Once an applicant
        has received an official nomination, they can apply to IRCC for Canadian
        permanent resident status.
