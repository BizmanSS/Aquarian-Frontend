              The Parents and Grandparents Program is an immigration program,
              whereby family members are sponsored by Canadian Citizens and
              Permanent Residents. This program contributes to the family
              reunification efforts of the Canadian government. To be a part of
              this program, sponsors are obligated to fill an
              Interest-to-Sponsor Form. They are selected based on a random draw
              after which they need to fill a sponsorship application to
              financially support their family after their PR. The parents or
              grandparents who are being sponsored must undergo medical exams
              and security screenings. Once the application is approved, they
              can obtain permanent residency in Canada.

              Who can Sponsor their Parents and Grandparents?
            </div>
            <div className="pages-paragraph">
              An eligible sponsor needs to be a Canadian citizen/permanent
              resident who meets certain criteria including:
              <ul className="my-5">
                <li>
                  The sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident
                  aged 18 or above.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They should not have defaulted on any previous sponsorship
                  agreements or owe money to the government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sponsor must primarily reside in Canada during the
                  application submission until the decision is made.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They must meet the minimum income requirement for the last 3
                  tax years. For applications in 2024, IRCC will assess income
                  from the tax years 2023, 2022, and 2021.
                </li>

                  Sponsors wishing to support their parents or grandparents
                  under the PGP must sign an undertaking with IRCC.
                </li>
              </ul>
              For those outside Quebec, this commitment lasts 20 years from the
              date the sponsored family members become permanent residents. For
              sponsors in Quebec, the commitment is 10 years. Additionally,
              sponsors must cover basic needs such as food, clothing, and
              utilities.
