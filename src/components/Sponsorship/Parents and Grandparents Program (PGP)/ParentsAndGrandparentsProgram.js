        The Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) is a unique Immigration
        program allowing both Canadian citizens and permanent residents to

        <sp>
          What are my ongoing obligations if I sponsor my parents or
          grandparents under the PGP?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Those wishing to sponsor their parents or grandparents under the PGP
        will need to sign an undertaking with IRCC. For sponsors residing
        outside the province of Quebec, this undertaking commits you to
        providing financial support for your sponsored family members for 20
        years from the date they become a permanent resident of Canada. In
        addition to this, you will need to repay any provincial social
        assistance your sponsored family member receives during the 20-year
        period.
        <br />
        <br />
        The undertaking also requires you to provide for the basic needs of your
        sponsored family members, including food, clothing utilities etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        For sponsors residing in the province of Quebec, the undertaking is for
        a duration of 10 years from the date your sponsored family members
        become permanent residents of Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          How much income do I need to show to sponsor my parents and
          grandparents under the PGP?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        All sponsors must make enough money to support their parents and
        grandparents in Canada. If invited to apply, the sponsor must show that
        they have met the income requirement for the last 3 tax years. If your
        spouse or common-law partner is acting as a co-signer on the
        application, you can use their income from the last 3 tax years towards
        meeting the minimum income cut off. For 2023 submissions, IRCC will
        assess the income from tax years 2022, 2021 and 2020.
        <br />
        <br />
        The total income you are required to demonstrate depends on the size of
        your family, the number of people you are sponsoring under the PGP and
        whether you are residing in Quebec. Minimum income requirements can be
        found here.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          COVID 19 affected my income, am I still eligible to sponsor my parents
          or grandparents under the PGP?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In response to COVID 19, IRCC has reduced the minimum income
        requirements for the 2020 tax year. In addition to this, sponsors can
        include the following benefits in their total income for the 2020 tax
        tear:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Regular employment insurance benefits; </li>{" "}
          <li>Any Canada Emergency Response Benefits; </li>{" "}
          <li>Other temporary COVID-19 related benefits</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>
          Can my spouse or common-law partner support my PGP sponsorship
          application?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes, your spouse or common-law partner can act as a co-signer on your
        PGP application. If your spouse or common-law partner acts as a
        co-signer on your application, you can use their income to meet the
        minimum income cut-off. Your spouse or common-law partner must also sign
        an undertaking to provide financial support for your parents or
        grandparents.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          Can I sponsor my parents or grandparents under the PGP if I am
          currently outside of Canada?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To sponsor your parents or grandparents under the PGP, the sponsor must
        be residing in Canada. This means that your primary residential address
        must be in Canada at the time the application is submitted, until a
        decision is made on the application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How do I receive an Invitation to Apply under the PGP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to receive an invitation to apply, the sponsor must first
        submit an interest to sponsor form to the IRCC PGP portal. The PGP
        portal accepts new interest to sponsor forms periodically throughout the
        year. The PGP portal is currently closed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          How interested are you in sponsor forms selected from the PGP portal?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Interest to sponsor forms are selected randomly from the PGP portal. If
        selected, the applicant will receive an email with a confirmation
        number. This confirmation number must be quoted when submitting the full
        application to sponsor your parent or grandparent.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          What documents do I need to submit an interest to sponsor form to the
          PGP pool?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You do not need to submit any documents when submitting an interest to
        sponsor form to the PGP portal. Instead, you will need to provide
        information to show you meet the eligibility requirements of the PGP
        program. This includes information on you as the sponsor, your family
        and the parents or grandparents you wish to sponsor. You should also be
        prepared to declare your income for the last 3 tax years.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          What document do I need to submit an application for permanent
          residence under the PGP?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have received an invitation to apply for the PGP, you must submit
        an application to sponsor your parents and grandparents. As part of this
        application, you can expect to submit the following:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Completed application forms;</li>
          <li>Proof of status in Canada;</li>
          <li>Proof of physical presence in Canada;</li>
          <li>Civil status documents;</li>
          <li>
            Proof you meet the minimum income cut-off for the 3 tax years prior
            to submitting the application;
          </li>
          <li>
            Police Certificate and Clearances from all countries your parent or
            grandparent has lived in for six months or longer past the age of
            18;
          </li>
          <li>Medical certificate for your parent and grandparent;</li>
          <li>Proof of payment for applicable government fees;</li>
          <li>Digital photo.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>How do I submit an application to the PGP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        All applications must be submitted online via IRCCâ€™s new permanent
        residence application portal. Only those suffering from a disability
        which prevents them from applying online can request an exemption to
        submit a paper-based application. This exemption is applied for via
        email and must be made as soon as possible after receiving the
        invitation to apply.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          How long do I have to submit an application after receiving an
          invitation to apply under the PGP?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        A full PGP sponsorship application must be submitted within 60 days of
        receiving the invitation to apply. The deadline to submit will be
        indicated on the invitation to apply letter you received from IRCC.

        <br />
        <br />
        No, your parents or grandparents do not need to have a job offer to be
        sponsored. Likewise, they have no obligation to work in Canada after
        becoming permanent residents through the PGP.
        <br />

        <br />
        <sp>Can I include my brothers and sisters in a PGP application?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You can include eligible brothers and sisters in a PGP application. To
        be eligible, your brothers and sisters must be under the age of 22 at
        the time the application is submitted or be financially dependent on
        your parents or grandparent due to a mental or physical condition.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I sponsor my in-laws under the PGP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        No, you cannot sponsor your in-laws under the PGP. You can however act
        as a co-signer on your spouseâ€™s PGP sponsorship application so long as
        your spouse meets the eligibility criteria as a sponsor.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          Are there any requirements my parents or grandparents need to meet to
          be sponsored under the PGP?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to be sponsored, parents or grandparents must be related to the
        sponsor by blood or adoption. In addition to this, they will need to
        pass a medical examination, be criminally admissible and provide
        biometrics.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What are the processing fees to apply under the PGP?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are no processing fees to submit an interest to sponsor form to
        the PGP portal. However, if you have received an invitation to apply,
        you must remit application processing fees as part of the application.
        The processing fees are $1050 per adult to be sponsored and $150 for any
        dependent child included in the application. In addition to this, there
        is a biometrics fee of $85 for one person or $170 for 2 or more people.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How long will my PGP application take to be processed?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Current estimated processing times as per IRCC for PGP applications
        range between 20 to 24 months.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          Can my parents or grandparents travel to Canada while they are waiting
          for their PGP application to be processed?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Yes, your parents and grandparents can travel to Canada while they are
        waiting for their PGP application to be processed. IRCCâ€™s super visa
