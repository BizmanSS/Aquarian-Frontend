        The family sponsorship program helps reunite families by allowing
        Canadian citizens or permanent residents who are the parents of a child
        abroad to apply to sponsor their child, or other dependent, for Canadian
        permanent residence.

        <sp>Definition of a Dependent Child</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To be eligible for sponsorship, children must meet the definition of a
        dependent child. Whether they are the biological or adopted child of a
        Canadian citizen or permanent resident, a child is considered to be a
        dependent if he/she is not married or in a common-law relationship and
        is under the age of 22. A child over the age of 22 will be considered a
        dependent if they suffer from a physical or mental condition that
        prevents them from being able to support themselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Dependent Child Sponsorship Requirements</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        As with all family sponsorship streams, both the sponsor and the
        sponsored person must meet eligibility requirements in order for the
        child to be granted permanent residence. Parents wishing to sponsor
        their child must:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident living in Canada</li>
          <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>
          <li>Not be in prison, charged with a serious offence, or bankrupt</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Parents will also be required to provide proof of the relationship with
        the child, be it through birth or adoption certificate. For parents in
        the end stages of an adoption process, they may sponsor the adopted
        child before the adoption has been finalised. In addition to meeting the
        definition of a dependent child, the sponsored person must either be the
        biological child of the sponsor or the sponsor’s spouse, or the adopted
        child of the sponsor or the sponsor’s spouse.

        <br />
        <sp>Sponsoring a Dependent Child in Quebec</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If the Canadian sponsor resides in the province of Quebec, will need to
        commit to a financial undertaking to support the family member they are
        sponsoring. The duration of the undertaking depends on the nature of the
        relationship. If the dependent child is under the age of 16, the sponsor
        must commit to financially supporting them for 10 years, or until the
        child is 18, whichever is longer. If the dependent child is 16 or older,
        the sponsor must commit to financially supporting them for three years,
        or until the child is 25, whichever is longer.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Dependent Child Sponsorship Minimum Necessary Income</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian citizens or permanent residents who are sponsoring the
        dependent children are not required to meet the Minimum Necessary Income
        (MNI), provided that the dependent child does not have any children of
        their own. If the dependent child being sponsored has dependent children
        of their own, the sponsor must meet the MNI required for their family
        unit size.
