        <sp>What is family class sponsorship?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada offers sponsorship programs for permanent residents or citizens
        of Canada that wish to bring their loved ones to Canada. These programs
        allow certain family members to become permanent residents of Canada.
        One of the most popular streams of Canadian immigration, family
        sponsorship programs make it easy for citizens and permanent residents
        to bring their spouse and immediate family members to Canada with
        reduced processing times because Canada knows that family should never
        be put on hold.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Who can I sponsor to come to Canada?</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Spouse, Common-law, or Conjugal Partner</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You may be eligible to sponsor your spouse, common-law, or conjugal
        partner for Canadian permanent residence, whether they are living in
        Canada with a valid temporary visa or residing abroad. Applicants who
        are living in Canada may also qualify for an open work permit, giving
        couples the chance to relieve some of their financial burdens.
        <br />
        <br />
        A spousal open work permit gives sponsored individuals the ability to
        work in Canada while their sponsorship application is being processed.
        Since Canada recognizes common-law partnerships, you may be eligible to
        apply for spousal sponsorship if you and your partner are not married
        but have been living together for a period of at least one year.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Parent or Grandparent Sponsorship</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada’s commitment to family reunification extends to parents and
        grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents through the
        parent and grandparent sponsorship program. In order to sponsor a parent
        or grandparent, citizens and permanent residents will be required to
        demonstrate that they can financially support their family by meeting
        the Minimum Necessary Income (MNI) for the size of their family unit.
        They must also agree to financially support their sponsored family
        members if needed. Sponsors who are unable to permanently support their
        parent or grandparent may be eligible for a Super Visa, a long term,
        multiple-entry visa for parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens
        and permanent residents.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Child or Other Dependant Sponsorship</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are immigrating to Canada, you can choose to include your
        children as accompanying dependents on your application for permanent
        residence. However, if you choose not to include them, or are otherwise
        unable to do so, they may still be able to join you in Canada later.
        Canada’s child sponsorship program allows Canadian citizens and
        permanent residents to sponsor their biological or adopted children
        under the age of 22 for permanent residence, as long as they are
        unmarried and have no children of their own. A child over the age of 22
        may be considered a dependent if they suffer from a physical or mental
        condition that prevents them from being able to support themselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Orphaned brother, sister, nephew, niece, or grandchild</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In some specific instances, Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents may
        be eligible to sponsor their orphaned brother, sister, nephew, niece, or
        grandchild to come to Canada. To sponsor your orphaned relative, they
        must be unmarried, under 18 years old, and related to you by blood or
        adoption.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          Other relatives (under exceptional circumstances as a “Lonely
          Canadian”)
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        In some rare circumstances, Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents may
        be eligible to sponsor one extended relative to come to Canada. To
        sponsor a relative that falls outside of Canada’s current Family Class
        definition, sponsors must be considered a “Lonely Canadian”. This means
        the sponsor has no spouse, common-law partner, child, parent, or
        grandparent.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How can I be eligible to sponsor a family member?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To sponsor a family member, you must meet minimum eligibility
        requirements. Eligible sponsors must:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident</li>
          <li>be at least 18 years old</li>
          <li>
            live in Canada, or plan to return to Canada once your spouse or
            partner becomes a permanent resident of Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            be able and willing to provide for the basic financial needs of your
            family member for three years
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>Who isn’t eligible to sponsor a relative?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are some cases in which a permanent resident or citizen is not
        eligible to sponsor. If one of the below scenarios apply, a sponsor may
        be ineligible if they:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>are currently in prison</li>
          <li>have not paid alimony or child support payments</li>
          <li>have declared bankruptcy and are not yet released </li>
          <li>
            received social assistance for reasons other than a disability
          </li>
          <li>
            failed to pay back an immigration loan, made late payments or missed
            payments
          </li>
          <li>
            have previously sponsored another relative and failed to meet the
            terms of the sponsorship agreement
          </li>
          <li>
            have been convicted of a violent crime, any offence against a
            relative or any sexual offence, depending on details of the case
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        How much does it cost to sponsor a family member in Canada?
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are sponsoring your spouse and they have dependent children, or
        if you are sponsoring your adopted child, a $150 payment will be
        required for each child included in the application. If you are
        including the spouse or partner of your relative, an additional $1,050
        is required. The government processing fees to sponsor a relative in
        Canada are listed below.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sponsorship fee <bold>$75</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Principal applicant processing fee<bold> $475 </bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Right of permanent residence fee<bold> $500</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Biometrics:<bold> $85</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Total:<bold> $1135</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        If the sponsor resides in or intends to reside in Quebec upon the
        issuance of permanent residence, a fee of $289 CAD will need to be paid
        in addition to the fees mentioned above.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is the income requirement for Canadian family sponsorship?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Minimum income requirements apply to some sponsorship applications,
        including parents, grandparents, eligible orphaned relatives, or those
        eligible under the “lonely Canadian” policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        These sponsors must meet the Minimum Necessary Income (MNI) required for
        the size of their family unit, and must also provide Canada Revenue
        Agency-issued Notices of Assessment (NOA) as proof that they have met
        the required MNI for at least three consecutive years.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike most other forms of Canadian sponsorship,
        <bold>
          {" "}
          you do not need to demonstrate a minimum amount of income to sponsor a
          spouse.{" "}
        </bold>
        However, whenever you sponsor a family member to Canada, you must sign
        an undertaking in which you promise to provide financial support for the
        basic needs of your sponsored family member. This undertaking is
        required for all sponsorship applications and acknowledges a sponsor’s
        promise to repay social assistance benefits paid to the sponsor and
        their family member(s) for a period of 20 years. A supplementary
        undertaking will need to be signed if the sponsor lives in Quebec.
        <br />
        <br />
        The length of the undertaking depends on the category of sponsorship.
        For spousal sponsorship (including spouses and common-law or conjugal
        partners), the length of the undertaking is 3 years from the day the
        sponsored individual becomes a Canadian permanent resident.
        <br />
        <br />
        Canadian citizens or permanent residents who are sponsoring their
        dependent children are not required to meet the Minimum Necessary Income
        (MNI), provided that their dependent child does not have any children of
        their own. If the dependent child being sponsored has dependent children
        of their own, the sponsor must meet the MNI required for their family
        unit size.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Do I need a job to sponsor a family member?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To sponsor a family member other than a spouse or partner, applicants
        must meet MNI requirements. While a job is not necessarily required,
        sponsors must provide proof of sufficient income from the past three
        years to support their sponsored family members.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How long does sponsorship take?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Sponsorship applications take approximately 12 months to process from
        start to finish. They are typically processed within 12 months but they
        can take longer depending on the nature of your case.

        </sp>

        <br />
        If sponsorship is not an option, your relative may be eligible under
        another Canadian immigration program. Take our free online assessment

        <sp>How many relatives can I sponsor to Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        There is no limit to the number of eligible family members a Canadian
        permanent resident or citizen can sponsor. However, applicants must
        submit separate applications for each eligible family member sponsored.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Sponsoring a family member in Quebec</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The federal government gives Quebec more autonomy in determining who
        will settle in their province. For this reason, permanent residents or
        citizens that reside in Quebec must first apply to the Quebec Ministère
        de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) for
        approval to sponsor their eligible family member. MIFI is responsible
        for approving a sponsorship undertaking for sponsors living in Quebec.

        <br />
        <sp>Canadian sponsorship background check</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        All individuals over the age of 18 applying for Canadian permanent
        residence must provide a Police Clearance Certificate to confirm they
        are not criminally inadmissible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Applicants must obtain police clearances from all countries they have
        resided in for 6 months or longer since the age of 18.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Canadian sponsorship biometrics</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada requires most immigration applicants to provide biometrics. Use
        Canada’s online tool to find out if you need to give your biometrics.
        <br />
        <br />
        After paying your biometric fee when submitting your application, you
        will receive a letter from IRCC with instructions on how to provide your
        biometrics.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Canadian sponsorship medical exam</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Individuals applying for Canadian permanent residence must undergo a
        medical exam to ensure they are not medically inadmissible.
        <br />
        <br />
        You do not need to submit your medical exam with your application. After
        submitting your sponsorship application, IRCC will provide instructions
        on how to complete your medical exam.
        <br />
        <br />
        The medical exam must be with a doctor on IRCC’s list of panel
        physicians.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>How do I check the status of my sponsorship application?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you applied for spousal, common-law, or dependent child sponsorship,
        you may track your application status using Canada’s Permanent Residence
        Application Tracker portal.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are sponsoring another family member, how you check your
        application status will depend on whether your application was submitted
        online or through the mail. Use IRCC’s online tool to learn more about
        how to check the status of your sponsorship application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Is there a deadline for Canadian sponsorship applications?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Eligible Canadian citizens and permanent residents may apply to sponsor
        their spouse or child at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Candidates applying to sponsor their parents or grandparents must be
        invited to do so and apply within the deadline provided.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I sponsor my brother or sister to come to Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        It is very difficult to sponsor your sibling to come to Canada as a
        Canadian citizen or permanent resident. This may only be done if you
        meet the criteria for a “Lonely Canadian,” or if your siblings can be
        included as dependents on your parental sponsorship application.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I sponsor my fiancé to come to Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada does not provide an option for Canadian permanent residents or
        citizens to sponsor their fiancé to come to Canada. Canadian citizens
        and permanent residents must get married to apply under the spousal
        sponsorship category.
        <br />
        <br />
        Alternatively, it may be possible to sponsor your fiancé to come to
        Canada if they qualify as a common-law partner.
        <br />
        <br />
        Can I sponsor my boyfriend or girlfriend to come to Canada?
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada does not offer a program to sponsor your boyfriend or girlfriend
        to come to Canada. You must be common-law partners or married to sponsor
        your boyfriend or girlfriend to come to Canada. In very specific
        circumstances, Canadian permanent residents and citizens may be eligible
        to sponsor their conjugal partner.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Can I sponsor my friend to come to Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Canada does not offer any program for a permanent resident or citizen to
        sponsor a friend.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your friend is interested in immigrating to Canada, they may be
        eligible under another immigration program.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Is there an age limit for sponsorship in Canada?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        To sponsor a family member, Canadian citizens or permanent residents
        must be at least 18 years old. There is no maximum age limit to sponsor
        a family member to come to Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        Can my spouse or common-law partner work in Canada while their inland
        spousal sponsorship application is being processed?
        <br />
        <br />
        If your spouse or common-law partner is living in Canada with a valid
        work permit, they may continue to work, without interruption, until
        their visa expires. If they are living in Canada with a valid study or
        visitor visa, they may be eligible to apply for an open work permit that
        allows them to work while their application is being processed.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am adopting a child. Do I need to wait until the adoption is final
        before I begin the sponsorship process?
        <br />
        <br />
        No. You can begin sponsorship if the adoption is in the final stages.
