        Canadian spousal sponsorship is how a Canadian citizen or permanent
        resident can sponsor their partner to come to Canada and live
        permanently. In Canada, we know how important it is for families to be
        together. For this reason, applications for spousal sponsorship are
        considered a top priority.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here is everything you need to know about sponsoring your spouse,
        common-law partner, or conjugal partner to Canada.
        <br />

        <sp>
          Who can sponsor their spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law partner
          under the spousal sponsorship program?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You may be eligible to sponsor your spouse, conjugal partner, or
        common-law partner if you are a <bold> Canadian citizen </bold>or
        <bold> permanent resident </bold>and meet the following conditions:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Are at least <bold>18 years old </bold>
          </li>
          <li>
            <bold>Live in Canada, or planning to return to Canada </bold>once
            your spouse or partner becomes a permanent resident of Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            Are able and willing to provide for the
            <bold> basic financial needs </bold>of your spouse or partner for
            <bold> three years </bold>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>In Canada Sponsorship Class</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You should apply under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class
        (Inland) if:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>You live with the sponsor in Canada</li>
          <li>You hold a valid immigration status in Canada</li>
          <li>
            You would like to apply for an open work permit in order to work in
            Canada while the application is in process
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        If your spouse or common-law partner is out of status in Canada, they
        may be able to submit under this stream as well while being protected
        under a public policy that allows them to stay in Canada until the
        application has been fully processed.
        <bold>
          {" "}
          The disadvantage to this particular stream, however, is that the
          applicant should refrain from travel outside of Canada while the
          application is in process.
        </bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>Family Class (Outland) Sponsorship Class</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You should apply under the
        <bold> Family Class (Outland) sponsorship option </bold>if:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your spouse/common-law partner (i.e., “the applicant”) lives outside
            of Canada
          </li>
          <li>
            You are currently living in Canada with the sponsor but do not plan
            to stay in Canada for the duration of the application process
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        A downside to using this stream is that, until your application has been
        approved, living with your spouse may be difficult. However, your spouse
        can apply for a temporary visa to come to Canada while their outland
        sponsorship application is being processed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          How long does it take to sponsor your spouse or partner to Canada?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Sponsorship applications take approximately 12 months to process from
        start to finish. They are typically not processed much faster than 12
        months, but they can take longer, depending on the nature of your case.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have a complicated case, or the visa office requires additional
        proof of your relationship, this will delay the processing of your case
        and it will take longer.
        <br />
        <br />
        <bold>
          The best way to ensure your sponsorship application is processed as
          quickly as possible is to make sure it is done right the first time.{" "}

          How much does It cost to sponsor your spouse, conjugal partner, or
          common-law partner to Canada?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        The government processing fees to sponsor your spouse, conjugal partner,
        or common-law partner in Canada are listed below. If you are sponsoring
        your spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law partner and they have
        dependent children, then an additional $150 payment will be required for
        each child included in the application.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sponsorship fee<bold> $75</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Principal applicant processing fee <bold> $475</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        Right of permanent residence fee<bold> $500</bold>

        Total: <bold>$1135</bold>
        <br />
        <br />
        If the sponsor resides in Quebec or intends to reside in Quebec upon the
        issuance of permanent residence, an additional fee of $289 CAD will need
        to be paid in addition to the fees mentioned above.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is common-law sponsorship?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under Canadian immigration law, common-law relationships are viewed as
        the same as conventional marriages. In order for your relationship to be
        eligible for common-law sponsorship, you must prove that as a couple,
        you have lived together for a year or longer in a marriage-like
        relationship.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>What is conjugal sponsorship?</sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Under certain circumstances where you are unable to marry or live with
        your partner as common-law, you may be eligible to sponsor a conjugal
        partner. In order to sponsor a partner, you must have been in a conjugal
        relationship for at least one year but were unable to live together or
        get married for reasons beyond your control.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sp>
          What are my ongoing obligations if I sponsor my spouse, conjugal
          partner, or common-law partner under spousal sponsorship?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        When sponsoring a spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law partner, you
        are responsible for fulfilling the basic needs of your partner,
        including their everyday and health needs for three years.
        <br />
        <br />
        You must make sure that your sponsored spouse, conjugal partner, or
        common-law partner does not require social assistance from the
        government before signing the undertaking agreement. If your spouse,
        conjugal partner, or common-law partner does require financial help from
        the government, you must pay back the full amount they received while
        you were legally responsible for them. If you do not pay back the full
        amount, you will not be permitted to sponsor another eligible family
        member until you do.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your financial obligation will stay in effect even if:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            your sponsored spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law partner
            becomes a Canadian citizen
          </li>
          <li>your relationship ends</li>
          <li>
            your spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law partner moves to
            another country or province
          </li>
          <li>you experience financial problems</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <sp>
          Do I need a job to sponsor my spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law
          partner in Canada?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        You do not need a job to sponsor your spouse, conjugal partner, or
        common-law partner to come to Canada. Unlike other sponsorship programs,
        there is no minimum income requirement for spousal sponsorship. However,
        as you are required to sign an undertaking agreement, promising to
        fulfil the basic financial needs of your partner, the immigration
        officer may assess whether you have sufficient funds to sponsor. As
        such, you should provide some proof of how you will support your spouse,
        conjugal partner, or common-law partner in Canada.
        <br />

        <sp>
          How much money do you need to sponsor your spouse, conjugal partner,
          or common-law partner to Canada?
        </sp>
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike most other forms of Canadian sponsorship,
        <bold>
          {" "}
          you do not need to demonstrate a minimum amount of income to sponsor a
          spouse, conjugal partner, or common-law partner.
        </bold>{" "}
        However, whenever you sponsor a family member to Canada, you must sign
        an undertaking, in which you promise to provide financial support for
        the basic needs of your sponsored family member. The length of the
        undertaking depends on the category of sponsorship. For spousal
        sponsorship (including spouses and common-law or conjugal partners), the
        length of the undertaking is 3 years from the day the sponsored
        individual becomes a Canadian permanent resident.
