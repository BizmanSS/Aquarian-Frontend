        Canadian employers often consider hiring foreign nationals for various
        reasons. It could be due to the lack of qualified Canadian candidates
        with the required skills for a specific position. Alternatively, they
        may be interested in supporting foreign individuals who are seeking
        permanent residency in Canada. Regardless of the motive, Canadian
        employers have access to a diverse range of hiring options when it comes
        to recruiting foreign nationals. These options cater to different needs
        and circumstances, ensuring that employers can find the right talent to
        meet their workforce requirements.
